" Don't waste your time
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,1,"I repeat, don't waste your time. Why did I continue playing this movie. Just time I'm unable to get back."
" Very suspenseful
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,8,The building and holding of suspense was really crisp. The ending wasn't quite my favourite and I found I had some unanswered questions.
" Good but frustrating
",2020-11-10 00:00:00,6,"Assuming this movie takes place in modern time, it's hard to believe that two 9 year old boys don't know much about guns and driving. They had to be the dumbest boys in that town. They lived in a very small town which I'm assuming they would have a lot of exposure to guns and motor vehicles or they would have video games. It's like these kids never heard of a car or guns, it was very frustrating to see how dumb they were. I guarantee every kid who has ever been in a car knows how to drive, they might not be good at it but they know how. Most the movie I just wanted to punch them both in the face. You can't use the excuse ""they're only 9"", no 9 year old boy knows that little.But Kevin bacon did make this movie somewhat entertaining, the plot was pretty good. I wish it would've dove more into that story then waste so much time on the two boys. The boys should've been a very small piece of the film."
" Strong scenario and good acting.
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,7,Nice story. Strong acting. Very good performances by the 2 young actors and protagonists. Impressive role by Kevin Bacon.
" Twisted view of the youth of america
",2020-10-17 00:00:00,4,"To start SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER ALERT. Sometimes you wonder what came into the writer to create the the main juvenile characters in the movie. To start with stealing the cop car in the first place but treat that as an oversite. Lets say it is a necessary start of the movie. Since it supposed to be games playing kids, the scene with the guns in the field where one should shoot at the other wearing the vest is completely lacking respect towards game developers and the kids who play them. Those kids know guns better then most adults, and normally know about the safety switch and do not look into the barrel of a gun. Hard to overcome. Drops the score to a measly 4"
" A Joyride to Remember
",2020-09-19 00:00:00,7,"This was a charming movie in a sort of way. The two kids are so innocent it's actually pretty funny.There's no backstory given to either the kids, or the predicament Kevin Bacon finds himself in. But it works, because you get hints here and there of what's going on, which are then easily pieced together. Then you're just along for the ride with the kids as Kevin Bacon scrambles in a desperate attempt to cover his tracks.Not a bad film at all, and quite easy to watch. A bit of a sudden ending, but I got a pretty good idea on how it turned out."
" Should be rated lower
",2020-09-07 00:00:00,3,"We chose this movie because of Kevin Bacon. What a mistake. It's a very slow movie, very pointless, poorly acted, poorly written with very little dialogue through the first 60 minutes. I can't imagine ever watching it again."
" I wish I could rate zero.
",2020-08-17 00:00:00,1,This is a pure garbage. Very very bad movie. I was expecting alot & in return got this waste of time. Actors are oweful as hell. Please do not waste your time.
" Pretty good
",2020-07-10 00:00:00,8,Another amazing performance by Kevin bacon. You can feel the tension being built throughout the film at every twist. You can feel yourself cringing at every bad mistake and dangerous thing the boys do. The movie clearly wants you to side with the boys because basically every other central character is not a very good person
" Good movie; lame-ass ending
",2020-07-04 00:00:00,6,"This was actually a pretty good film; despite some stupid dialog here and there, I was riveted until the end when I wanted to throw my remote at the tv."
" Really Fun & Enjoyable
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,6,"Totally surprised at how much I liked this movie. i hadnt heard anything about this movie & it looked like some low budget film that Kevin Bacon had to do cause he owed someone but I was wrong. It was very entertaining & Kevin Bacon was so spot on as the Sherriff, the faces he makes & his mannerisms are a perfect match. I thought it seemed a bit slow at first but (possibly a spoiler here) once I saw Bacon running, trying to find his car, I was hooked."
" What did I just watch??
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,3,I find it hard to understand how this movie is rated so high. The actions of all characters is annoyingly unrealistic. Much time wasted on trivial things. Found myself fast forwarding through several scenes. Are people rating it high because of Bacon? Sorry I just want a good story and this aint it.
" 90's Style Neo-Noir
",2020-01-25 00:00:00,7,"Just finished it and gotta say it was excellent. I was pretty much on the edge of my seat throughout the film, but still it wasn't overly tense. I love films where there's no clear protagonist and like many '90's films which this reminds me of, everyone is a bad guy. Even the kids, though innocent, make you want to scream at them - ""wtf did you think you were doing!"", lol."
" Overall A Pretty Good Movie - Especially The Young Boys - Alot Closer To Reality Than You Might Think
",2020-01-25 00:00:00,9,"01/24/2020 This was definitely an enjoyable movie. The two young boys were excellent in the characters that they played. Their actions and dialog, in the circumstances given (stealing a car with keys in it) was pretty typical of young 10ish year olds, especially country boys. Kevin's character was a little wifty (not so believable) but overall good fun to watch considering that this is my 3rd or 4th time. Watch for yourself and decide? Bon Appetit"
" Bacon Amazing Again
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,7,I think this movie is exactly what I would do if I found a cop car asa a kid. Kevin Bacon is great in this movie.
" Good birth control for people on the fence about starting a family
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,7,"This movie tells the story about those kids who are just born with no fear. When we were still just roaming packs of hunter/gatherers, I'm sure this was a fantastic skill set. These days, you'll just have a lot more contact with principals and counselor's and law enforcement than seems fair. Maybe you deserve it because you were a gigantic pain in the ass as a kid. But my firm belief is that it's only us people who were complete woosies who bear these kids. We have no practical point of reference. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ That being said, This is a fun romp. It's like when you see somebody else at the grocery store dealing with their toddler who didn't get their nap. Funny as hell, then, right?,ðŸ˜‰"
" Almost a great thriller
",2020-01-03 00:00:00,5,"You have a perfect little thriller... Great acting, pacing, dark humor, tension, suspense and you put one of those dumb ass arbitrary cut-off endings on that you half to know will just piss people off and wreck a little gem of a movie...I guess that's why i never heard of it before now"
" Yet another crappy ending
",2019-11-12 00:00:00,5,"I'm beginning to think very few writers can write a decent ending anymore. I've seen so many films in the last few years where the movie is enjoyable until the end. It's like they have a good idea, but have no idea how to end it, so they just give up, and tack on a meaningless ending. I give this a five because of Bacon, and some funny parts with the boys playing with the guns."
" Cop Car (2015)
",2019-11-08 00:00:00,7,"Directed by Jon Watts. Starring Kevin Bacon, Hays Wellford, James Freedson-Jackson, Shea Whigham, Camryn Manheim, Sean Hartley, (voice) Kyra Sedgwick. (R)A couple of delinquent kids stumble upon an abandoned cop car and take it for a joy ride; Bacon is the small-town cop who needs to find it right away (like, really needs to find it). Compact, well-made thriller, directed confidently and photographed with precision. Watts knows how to deliberately ratchet up the tension as the story unfolds, but the plotting becomes less clever on the back end, leading to more conventional episodes of standoffs and violence. Bacon's performance isn't particularly deep, but it's believable, and he's able to tease at the frayed fringes of his messy, immoral character; the young actors do solid work, too, and the screenplay wisely acknowledges the way that kids can blow trivial details out of proportion and yet shrug at most consequences (it's less convincing, however, that the whipper-snappers could figure out how to drive a car so quickly).71/100"
" A movie that does everything right
",2019-10-03 00:00:00,9,"Shame on Hollywood for not promoting this movie, like it's some kind of grade B loser. It is certainly not. It's top notch filmmaking and acting.What fun it is to watch this movie. Not that's it's a comedy; it's a very dark film with black humor. The fun is in appreciating great filmmaking, scene after scene.Like a Coen Brothers film, it has lines of dialogue that make you laugh out loud in spite of the blackness. When the two kids are running away from home across the Colorado badlands, one kids asks the other, ""How far do you think we've come?"" The other kid answers, ""Fifty miles."" More than likely, it's been less than a mile.
When the unfortunate woman who saw the kids driving the cop car is looking for the sheriff's car keys, leading up to the violent climax, the sheriff (Kevin Bacon) says, ""You did a real good thing, ma'am. It's citizens like you who make a difference in our community. Taking an active role."" We're laughing in spite of ourselves.This film is concise and tightly plotted, evocative of of the Coen Brothers' first movie _Blood Simple_ in terms of mood, deadpan objectivity, cinematography of the bleak rural west, and the theme of a plan that goes badly wrong.But story-wise, it's not derivative. It's quite original. The two child actors, James Freedson-Jackson and Hays Wellford, both turn in incredible performances. Kevin Bacon does the same. Shea Wigham, as the ""bad"" guy, delivers a monologue to the two kids that that you will never forget. The writer and director, John Watts, deserves credit for the dialogue and for keeping this film so economical and tense.The setup is perfect; the plot is perfect; the soundtrack music by Phil Mossman is perfect; the camera work is perfect; the ambiguous ending is perfect.There is no character development, because a movie like this doesn't need it. It's all about ""what happens.""Impressive. One of the best movies of 2015. Needless to say, the Hollywood moguls were too busy promoting their inane big box office blockbusters to put a lot of promotion behind this film. But if you're a real aficionado of great cinema, you will love this."
" To slow
",2019-09-27 00:00:00,5,I wanted to like this and tried but could not enjoy the film. It is an youths adventure with a twist.
" Huh
",2019-08-10 00:00:00,3,Not sure why this got so many positive reviews. This movie dragged on and on and got nowhere really fast. I hope Kevin Bacon got a good laugh for making this movie. Stay away.
" Fun little movie
",2019-08-09 00:00:00,7,"The film brings you back to what it's like being a curious little kid being in a world way over your head. Kevin Bacon's performance is top notch. It's so dark and twisted but you're really seeing it through childs eyes which puts it through an innocent and adventurous lense. I definently reccomend it, it's short fun and keeps you on the edge. The only complaint is that I wish I could have more. 79%"
" Don't call the police on this one!
",2019-08-03 00:00:00,6,"This movie starts by showing who will build and I kind of liked that. It also takes turns that I expected slightly but did it in different ways. It gave me anxiety all the way through which is a great quality of a thriller and Shea Whigham once again through indie roles has proved me can be anything. The chameleon almost overshadows Kevin Bacon. And by almost, I mean had the script not called for what it did, he probably would have. This movie will keep you guessing as to who will die and how, and who is right or wrong. Anxiety meter I give 5 popcorns."
" my notes
",2019-07-22 00:00:00,4,"Very boring. some unique and suspenseful scenes but mostly bleh. it really wasn't bad in any way, it just didn't do much for me (1 viewing)"
" great movie for those suffering from insomnia.
",2019-07-09 00:00:00,1,The acting was no better than watching my neighbors kids play in the yard. don't waste your time.
" Needs a more plausible script
",2019-07-08 00:00:00,3,"Cop Car could have been a good movie. As I'm sure everyone knows, it involves two children, about 10 to 12 years old, who are running away from home. No reason for this act is ever given. They come across an unattended sheriff's vehicle in a remote area, and decide to take it for a joyride. The sheriff returns to find his vehicle missing, and we're now well aware that he is a corrupt, dirty cop. The kids find themselves in a lot more dangerous situation than they ever thought possible.The problem with this movie is that the script calls for these slightly preteen kids to have the thought processes and actions of five-year-olds in kindergarten, not kids in 5th to 7th grades.SPOILERS FOLLOW
First of all, did you ever run away from home as a child, or know someone who did? In all cases that I know of, it's been little kids (5 years old or so) who got perhaps a block from home before realizing their mistake. I realize that in the case of teenagers with bad home lives (real or imagined), they may make an earnest attempt to get away from their families, but in those cases, the efforts always include much more serious preparation than putting a single piece of beef jerky in a jacket pocket.Ridiculous moments:1. The kids have been ""running away from home"" for what is obviously a brief period, and one of them asks the other how far he thinks they've traveled. The other kid says ""50 miles."" A four- or five-year-old might say this. A child in middle school knows how long it takes to go 50 miles in a car, and would never say this in answer to how far they've traveled in an hour or two on foot.2. Daring each other to go TOUCH the empty car (REALLY?) then deciding to STEAL the cop car. 5th to 7th graders would realize that this was something that could get both of them in serious trouble. The only way I would believe children of that age would decide to do this is if they were shown to have been ""bad kids"" to begin with. Instead, they just appear to be clueless, like four-year-olds.3. What middle-class 5th-to-7th grade boy who has been driven around for years by his parents and others doesn't know the way a typical car with an automatic transmission works? These kids act like they are seeing a car for the first time when they decide to drive it.Similarly, they don't seem to realize that you are supposed to stay in the right lane on two lane roads. It might have made sense, since the roads are so deserted, to drive down the middle and have a wider margin of safety on each side, but driving along in the opposite traffic lane for miles at a time? Again, behavior appropriate to kindergartners.4. Guns. They can't figure out how to make loaded guns fire? Although Hollywood gives us a lot of bad or misleading information about guns, any fifth grader who has been watching television would know at least to look at the markings on the side of the AR-15 and to see if the selector lever was on ""safe"" or ""fire.""This happens when one genius decides to put on the policeman's body armor and have his friend shoot him. Again, five-year-old behavior. A fifth grader would prop the vest up against something, shoot it, and look at the result.The premise of this movie COULD have worked if the young runaways were running from something seriously bad, and made the shrewd calculation to steal the police car and use it to get much farther from home, then conceal it from discovery by hiding it somewhere and continuing on anonymously by some other means, and THEN get drawn into the nightmare. Instead, the kids just act like annoying, clueless idiots 100% of the time.As scripted, Cop Car could, as one other reviewer put it, be more accurately titled ""Dumb and dumber--the early years."""
" Worst movie ever watched
",2019-07-05 00:00:00,1,"This was the worst movie that I've ever watched. The beginning the was weird with the kids walking in a field cursing, Kevin Bacon running in the field after he found out the cop car was gone, you never know why the people were being killed all the way thru to the ending. I've seen much better movies from Kevin Bacon and I'm sure there will be better."
" Enjoyable action movie... loved it
",2019-07-04 00:00:00,8,"The coming of age of two boys. Curious, innocent, yet devious and wildly charismatic. The young actors marvel before legendary Kevin Bacon who goes off the chain with his level of acting. This movie totally rocks, man!"
" Worth a Watch
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,7,Kevin Bacon fans will enjoy this movie. The movie has some flaws such as a script and characters that are under-developed. However its still worth a watch and it kept me interested throughout. A good movie overall especially for something on Netflix.
" No Surprise That Bacon Produced
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,5,"The kids acted great and Kevin, well, he acted like he usually does. OK for passing the time but not worth remembering or recommending to anyone."
" Can you smell the bacon cooking?
",2019-06-23 00:00:00,9,"341. Cop Car. An intense, straight to the point thriller. It all starts when two footloose and fancy free boys discover a police cruiser seemingly abandoned in a clearing in the woods. After scoping out the scene for quite awhile, seeing no woodsmen or a sign of the police officer, they decide to take it out for a joyride, creating a tremor of serious unease for the owner of the car. Ya see, the car wasn't abandoned, the officer was just tending to other matters, of the illegal variety. Now being a police officer he knows a few things about criminal law and has a few tricks up his sleeve to get the car back. He sets aside panic mode, calls police dispatch and calmly explaining that he is having radio issues and to call him on his cell, once the call ended, the feeling of being trapped and panic instantly returns demonstrating what a truly hollow man he is. And off he goes running like the river wild to find his car. Meanwhile as the boys are having the time of their life driving through picture perfect scenery until a slight stir of echoes appears to be coming from the trunk, discovering the next dirty secret by the cop, a bloodied up dude in the trunk, looking like he just committed murder in the first somehow still gains the trust of the two young boys and the upper hand, using them as bait, almost assuring us that they will never grow into a few good men, into a final confrontation that also includes an innocent bystander who could have sworn she saw two kids joyriding in a police car, she attempted to speak to officers but quickly turned into a he said, she said type thing, and just happened to cross paths with the gang at the end of the line The results? Well I can't tell you that. Will the boys dreams about becoming like the Apollo 13 astronauts die today, will everyone just flatline?? Will help arrive in time to give this psycho cop his deserved punishment, a death sentence? Pretty exciting movie! Worth the watch!! Filmbufftim on FB"
" Great triller
",2019-06-23 00:00:00,8,Suspense and black humor grow together masterfully.
" Horrible movie
",2019-06-23 00:00:00,1,Bad movie that ends worse. Could not believe I took the time to watch.
" Degrees of Kevin Bacon
",2019-06-21 00:00:00,6,"A compact film - neither a Coen brother's modern Western nor a horrible no-budget - it features to passable child actors up against Kevin Bacon - as a corrupt sheriff. This is a passable movie that I enjoyed on a late night with nothing else to do - and didn't feel it time wasted. Kevin Bacon puts on an excellent performance as a desperate, despicable cop - somehow you feel this is the type of character he was born to play."
" Fun and original
",2019-06-18 00:00:00,8,"This was a very well made film. The story was fun and original. The acting is lacking at times, however; the originality of the movie and the writing and direction successfully manage to overshadow the flaws."
" Liked it :)
",2019-06-17 00:00:00,7,"It's a 6 or 7! Worth catching, it's pretty original"
" Little nice movie
",2019-05-05 00:00:00,6,"The idea is quite weird. The execution is quite good. It's better than the average low-profile thriller. Overall, it's an interesting watch with some good cinematography."
" DID YOU OPEN THE TRUNK?
",2019-04-18 00:00:00,6,"Two kids (10-11?) are walking away from home when they discover what appears to be an abandoned cop car out in the middle of nowhere. They take the car for a joy ride. Meanwhile in a flashback, Kevin Bacon, a dishonest cop had been disposing of a body. When he discovers his car is missing, he must go to great lengths to try to recover the vehicle.While the acting was decent, I just didn't feel the excitement. I liked the concept, but somehow it didn't come off well. They omitted scenes, such as when the woman goes to talk to two police officers. We didn't get to see it. It should have been an interesting scene. The killing? The drug deal gone bad? Some background?Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
" Silly Idea which worked out pretty well.
",2019-04-15 00:00:00,7,"An interesting watch for people who enjoy movies which are made on the ""What If"" factor. Kevin bacon was at his best. Top notch performances by the kids. Felt the ending could have been better though. You won't regret watching it. Intriguing and to the point."
" This film is FABULOUS
",2019-04-13 00:00:00,9,"I saw it back when it was made. Came here to enjoy all the rave reviews. WTF, people?! I can't believe everybody isn't raving about this film.Excellent work by Kevin Bacon and EVERYBODY else. The WRITING!I love that all these people agreed to participate in this delightful and understated work.CLEARly it has yet to find its audience. OR, they, like me, just assumed we all wrote rave reviews to go along with our rave experiences. Hmmmm . . .Well, I've done my part. Sorry it took me so long."
" The Thrill Ride Is Just Getting Starting...
",2019-01-10 00:00:00,7,"Kevin Bacon (lead star from recent TV series ""The Following)"" stars in this new (B Grade feel) thriller ""Cop Car""
The basic plot: two teenage boys are walking around a bush talking trash, breaking anything they can find & basically being bored out of their brains (as you would!). Things get very interesting when they stumble across an unattended (and not to mention unlocked) ""Cop Car"".After daring back and forth the two decided to take it for a ride. Things turn for the worse when a strange, shady, sweaty, suspicious police officer (Kevin Bacon) returns only to find that clearly someone has taken his ""Cop Car"".The film does a fantastic job of bringing the ""Cop Car"" to life and made it clear that the car was something very unknown and something one should afraid of even just to touch.Kevin Bacon plays to perfection the suspicious cop and I should also point out the two new young teenage male actors also should be credited.Certain scenes I discovered do take longer to complete and may annoy some viewers. I personally enjoyed these scenes as it felt more real. For example: watching Kevin Bacon break into a car takes him many tries rather than a corny ""oh he got it unlocked 1st go""...Certain questions are unanswered as the credits roll but overall I was left feeling very content and wanting to see more.I enjoyed this film so much that I even found myself viewing the Blu-Ray special features (which I don't normally do!)7.4/10

" Bring home the bacon.
",2018-12-16 00:00:00,6,"'Cop Car (2015)' is a low-key, kind-of-slow but ultimately unconventional 'coming-of-age'-drama come crime-thriller. This strange little indie flick finds its footing as a difficult to define genre-mashup, an insular and almost callous 'buddy vs cop' kind of thing, which goes exactly where it wants to and nowhere else, feeling somewhat enigmatic and ominous yet friendly and childlike as it does. It is, essentially, a low-speed chase, as our two kid heroes innocently operate their newly found car and the cop to whom it belongs ruthlessly hunts them down. It culminates in a tense, firefight-focused finale that makes the movie's stakes especially clear, ultimately being a relatively entertaining experience that leaves you with mixed emotions; while it's well-made, it lacks the impact to really stick with you. 6/10"
" Good indie film
",2018-12-15 00:00:00,7,This movie deals with two boys who have run away from home and steal a cop car to get as far away from home as possible. The cop is corrupt and he goes after the boys. The boys are also in trouble from a criminal in the trunk of the car who they help escape (out of their good hearts) only to have him betray them and use them as hostages. The boys are basically innocent and the adults are corrupt - and the boys face the future of what they might turn into if they don't go back home and learn not to do stuff like - oh I dunno - steal cop cars.
" Hard Film to Make and Still Be Interesting
",2018-11-03 00:00:00,7,"Fans of film making will appreciate how difficult it is to make a movie like this interesting. Because if the high quality TV we have had for a decade now, this type of film is compared to great shows like Breaking Bad & Better Call Saul. I would argue those shows direction and style are better than this movie, but one thing will never change--excellent acting. Both Kevin Bacon and Shea Whigham do just that! Bacon is prime for these types of roles. Perfect casting. Camryn Manheim has a small role but again, quality acting. She nails her part and in less than five seconds owns the character she plays. The boys are good but not a lot expected from kid actors, however that could have ruined the movie.There is a lot of open space in this film, long extended scenes and the direction for the kids could have been tighter. With kids there is little subtlety. They are on or off, silly or sad and cannot blend moods naturally from concerned, to angry to a fight.I argue it is much more difficult to make a movie like this work over a higher budget film. Movies like this can appear similar to a TV episode."
" Just Ok movie
",2018-06-13 00:00:00,6,"Nice concept. Kevin Bacon did a great job, but the ending was bad."
" It's a cat and mouse game where the stakes can get you killed
",2018-03-19 00:00:00,7,"I'm sure there are many viewers who just do not believe this plot is realistic. I mean, why would a small town sheriff (Kevin Bacon) leave his cop car unattended while in the process of burying a man he just killed? No, I never did run into a similar incident but as a young boy my friends and I found ourselves in a few positions of opportunity that most young boys would run away from whereas we ran towards the trouble.These two young boys named Travis (James Freedson-Jackson) and Harrison (Hays Wellford) feed off of each others sense of adventure and as their respective parents are somewhat absent (Harrison is being raised by his grandmother and Travis has his mother and a stepfather) they stumble upon Sherif Kretzer's unattended cop car and like two kittens who start pawing at a ball of yarn, before they can say MEOW their next behind the cop car's wheel and rolling down them there hills doing 100 miles per hour.This film takes place over a short span of a few hours and as most parents can attest to as well as any juvenile delinquent, it does not take these two particular ten year old mischievous boys long to find a little bit of trouble escalate into a whole lot of trouble. When the boys stop their joyriding they soon realize that there is someone in the trunk of the cop car who Sheriff Kretzer has certainly laid a pretty bad beating on. The boys untie the bloodied prisoner (Shea Whigham) only to have the man they just helped confiscate their rifles they have been playing around with and lock the two mischievous boys in the back of the cop car using them as bait waiting for just the right opportunity to get his revenge on Sheriff Kretzer.It's a cat and mouse game and these two young boys did not deserve the fate bestowed upon them but nor did they have to initiate it either by stealing a cop car. The film is not without some faults but let's just say ""that stupid is, as stupid does, and trash like this can and does happen from time to time."" I liked the film overall and I give it a 7 out of 10 rating."
" The Makers of ""Cop Car"" should have Policed themselves.
",2017-10-27 00:00:00,4,"Hey, I'm as big a fan of Kevin Bacon as the next guy. Or gal. Oh, let's just say human. I thought his presence in the 2015 film ""Cop Car"" would make it a worthwhile ride. Alas, with a nod to the vernacular of the '60's hippie culture, it was more like a bad trip, man.With scenes appearing to suggest that it is cute to observe 10-year-old boys ""play"" with guns, and then watch as these same children drive a stolen vehicle at 80 miles per hour, ""Cop Car"" feasts upon the bottom of the barrel in a desperate attempt at hip and edgy entertainment.In the end it is all at the expense of any scrap of entertainment at all."
" CinemaSins was wrong on this one. This movie is an insult to kid's intelligence and the viewers.
",2017-10-12 00:00:00,3,"Is this how adults think kids act/dialogueÂ… do adults really think kids are this stupid behind closed doors? No wonder why kids are jackholes, because they're treated with such condescension and given such little respect. I can't stand kids, yet apparently, I inadvertently find myself being one of the most empathetic people when it comes to kids. The level of the two kid's stupidity in this movie (or the writer's stupidity) is the equivalent of dying from dehydration because they forgot they were thirsty type s__t! And I'm not talking about the kids taking the cop car either. I'm talking about virtually all their dialoguing and actions outside of this. However, they did go from the extreme of running up to the cop car, touching it, then running away (I swear I'm not making this up) to a minute later, putting the keys in the ignition and driving away? Who writes this stuff? At one point they take the riffles out of the cop car and they're trying to literally shoot one another with bullet proof vests on, but luckily for them they didn't figure out how to shut off the safety. So, imagine being a 9-year-old who found a person all bloody and bound in the trunk of a cop car, who's crying and pleading for his life before during and after you open the trunk. What would be the first thing you would say or do? These kids stick riffles in the guy's face and ask if he's a bad guy. Apparently, they would kill him if he said yes (now we find out later that the kids didn't think the guns worked, however there are contradictions, like at one point the one kid suggest shooting the ties off). I'm not saying two 9-year-olds wouldn't be cautious. He is in the trunk of a Sheriff car after all, but the guy's tied up and bleeding. I guarantee you that 100% of non- mentally challenged people 5 and up would first wonder and ask, what happened before anything else (also who are you, are you OK). Skepticism would possibly come after the confusion/wonder and the questions, not out of the gate. At this point it's not outside the lines of reason for the kids to free a bound man pleading Â… that's a realistic kind of kid stupid. It's the conditions they have, which make it such a gargantuan insult to kid's intelligence. If he doesn't tell their grandma, mom, step dad or any of their teachers, he can go. You've got to be F-ing kidding me? Do I even have to break down the many ways this is beyond the realm of stupidity for a 9-year-old? At first the kids don't have anything to cut the ties with, so the one kid says let's shoot them off and proceeds to point the gun at the ties which are directly in front of the man's face. Even if action movies were the extent of a 9-year old's knowledge on guns, a kid would have to know that the bullet would pass through the plastic into the mans face. You can literally go line by line in this movie picking it apart, for example, continuing from there. The boys must find something to cut the man loose. The one kid finds a pocket knife from the car and tells his friend as he's handing it to him, ""the tweezers and the tooth pick are missing, but it has the knife part"". Who gives a s__t about the tooth pick and the tweezers. Why mention this? Then just before they're about to cut him loose the one kid says, ""you can't have this cop car, it's our cop car, we found it and we're not going to let you have it, okay"". I f__king give up! These kids aren't considered mentally challenged either. The dude who wrote this dialogue is beyond ignorantÂ… just because he was obviously this stupid when he was 9 years old, doesn't mean that you could find two kids on a continent let alone in the same area to be that stupid and it's extremely ignorant to think that there would be. So, they free the guy, he turns out to be bad and he throws them in the back of the cruiser. As the man goes off to go do something about 200 meters away the one kid whispers ""look"" and the other kid loudly goes ""shhhhhhhhhh"" and the other kid whispers back ""he can't hear us"". So, these kids are essentially just now figuring out how sound works for the first time. To make a long story short the inevitable happens and the one kids shoots himself. It really doesn't matter if the kid/s live or not in this instance, because we know within a year or so the odds are astronomically in favor of both kids being deadÂ… it goes against the laws of nature that these kids made it to the age of 9 as it is."
" Elegantly combines action, dark humour and a believable coming-of-age tale
",2017-07-22 00:00:00,7,"For anyone with children of their own, Jon Watts' Cop Car may just be one of the most uncomfortable cinematic experiences you'll ever sit through, as it revels in putting its two young protagonists through hell as part of their unique coming-of-age. The two baby- faced runaways at the story's centre are played with incredible naturalism by James Freedson-Jackson and Hays Wellford, which will no doubt make the movie all the more distressing for any doting parents. The rest of us can marvel at an incredibly well-constructed and tightly-wound thriller, which also ventures into neo-noir territory akin to early work of the Coen Brothers and, more recently and albeit with less blood, Jeremy Saulnier's Blue Ruin. It's a small piece of work that didn't escape the eyes of Marvel Studios, who quickly snapped Watts up for their delicate reboot of Spider- Man.Opening in a vast field in the middle of nowhere, pre-teens Travis (Freedson-Jackson) and Harrison (Wellford) wander aimlessly practising swearing and sharing a Slim Jim. It's soon becomes clear that they have run away from home, but less clear is why and just how far they've come. Their boredom is soon relieved by the sight of an empty police car, parked suspiciously with keys still in the ignition and an empty beer bottle on the hood. Curiosity naturally gets the better of them and they are soon revving up the engine and teaching themselves how to drive. If anyone pulls them over, they'll just claim to be the police. We are then treated to a flashback, in which we learn that the car's owner, Sheriff Kretzer (Kevin Bacon), is not a very nice man at all. He strips to his vest, dons gloves, and proceeds to pull a body out of the trunk and buries it. When he returns to his parking spot and realises his grave error, he quickly starts to cover his tracks and hunt down the thieves.The plot of Cop Car relies heavily on sheer stupidity. Kretzer, an experienced officer, should not have left the keys behind, or his gun, or the soon-to-be-discovered roughed-up criminal in the trunk (played by Shea Whigham). But many great thrillers are built upon the clumsy actions of the buffoons driving the action, and Cop Car is no exception. In keeping the characters backgrounds a mystery, they come unpredictable, and the film becomes increasingly intense because of this. Watts and Christopher Ford's screenplay carefully moves its small band of characters into place (including a nosy bystander played by Camryn Manheim whose good intentions seem to be destined for tragedy) for a thrilling finale that manages to keep you on the edge of your seat right up to the very last scene. Passed on for a cinema release, Cop Car is a fine example of the kind of surprises to be found with straight-to-DVD titles, elegantly combining action, dark humour, and a believable coming-of-age tale."
" Slow paced brilliant thriller
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,8,"Shades of No Country For Old Men, and that takes some direction, cinematography and screenplay. As one of the other reviewers on IMDb said, this movie is reassuring that the Spiderman reboot is in good hands. Definitely worth a watch if you like(d) movies from the Coen Brothers ""edge of the seat slow thrillers"" genre"
" Smells like teen spirit
",2017-04-01 00:00:00,8,"This is what I call an underrated film. Beautifully shot, strong performances by these two wonderful juvenile actors and obviously that Kevin Bacon just don't know how to deliver a bad performance. Jon Watts made this movie with passion and most probably with some classics on his mind, Cop Car kind of reminds me Stand by Me (1986) which is a great achievement. Enough said, 6.4 its a joke for such a pleasant flick. A must see '8'"
" Good film with slow start -- Not a ""Feel Good"" film
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,8,"I had never heard of this film but my Tivo picked it up. It turned out to be a pretty good, apparently low budget film. The beginning is slow as the movie spends a bit of time trying to set up the improbable event that leads to the main narrative. (Anybody who knows the name of the movie and/or has read anything about the movie knows what is coming, but I will avoid saying it just in case.) Once that events happen, things flow along fairly steadily. The limited cast does a good job. I though Camryn Manheim's role was especially good because it was a very dark comic relief. It was so good that I wasn't sure that there was really any comedy rather than just nervous release/relief. The movie presents a dark outlook on the world (or maybe just rural America), so don't watch it if you are easily depressed."
" Not bad but ends too soon
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,7,"The story at least is more believable than most. I think there are slight inconsistencies in the boy's ability to drive a car but the only clear example of that I saw was that one time they don't know how to use the brakes then just a minute later (their time; seconds for us) they use the brakes just fine.I think there is not enough character development but at least you won't feel as if the movie spends too much time with character development. About the only character development in the beginning is that the boys use swear words and dare the other to say the same words. That is how the movie begins.The story occurs in Colorado but only on large, dry plains and the only hills are far in the background.There are many things that are not clear (many questions that are never answered) and be prepared for a sudden ending.One thing that should be clarified is that in the beginning things are shown out of sequence. This is only at the beginning. They show the boys then they show someone else but part of what that someone else does happens before part of what the boys do. You will figure it out but it helps to be prepared.Other than that it is a good story."
" Jarring in some places, endearing in others
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,5,"Here is a film I have no clue how to approach. I honestly have no idea what to say. The basic premise is solid- two boys find an abandoned police car and take it for a joyride. Turns out that the car belongs to the crooked sheriff, and he will do just about anything to get it back. Now the first sentence sets up a goofy family comedy with lots of naive-car-hijinks and maybe some misuse of police equipment. The second sentence however, especially with the extremely versatile Kevin Bacon in the role of a crooked cop, sets up a gritty and dark revenge sort of action thriller, which is really different when the ""felons"" are two 10-year-olds. Now both parts of the film work separately quite well. The boys are convincing, curious and clueless and have good chemistry together, and very few actors can out-creep Kevin Bacon when he's even remotely trying, and he is in this feature. The issue is, that when the two separate parts collide we as an audience are treated to a jarring experience that at times is downright unpleasant. Worth watching, maybe... but don't expect it to be ""fun"", and definitely don't let your kids watch it."
" Good movie
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,9,"Solid film, the type I wish they'd make more of. Great characters. Their back stories are hinted at and your imagination fills in the gaps. Great writing. The dialogue has weight and sounds natural. Great scenery. It's on the outskirts of an old dusty town, way out in the back-roads of somewhere and it looks beautiful. Great story line and a great score all at a nice pace and under a one and half hour running time. It has no need for flashy, gimmicky explosions or a convoluted and overly-complicated plot. This is the best film I saw this summer.It's a simple original story that keeps you wondering what will happen next. I don't know how a film like this can get made any more.Kevin Bacon was pretty great too."
