" Great Movie
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,8,"Great movie which chronicles the unnecessary hardship, grief and stress inflicted on so many people by a government scheme that does not work !Hayley Squires. Very good and one to watch for.Only gripe is he collapsed in a government office and no o e administered CPR.Loved it."
" The day the film will lose its relevance, the world will be a happier place...
",2021-03-04 00:00:00,9,"This is Daniel Blake, played by Dave Johns. For his doctor, he's a patient with a heart condition. For the Department of Work and Pensions, he's an entity, a number, an impersonal element that didn't pass the test that could earn him a disability pension. For his neighbor (Kema Sikazwe), he's a widower and sympathetic old curcumdgeon. And for us, he's a most resourceful and honest man, a product of the Baby Boom generation, a man who does things with his hands as efficiently as his heart and doesn't beg for money but only desires the insurance of a decent living. He's got pride and dignity, he's an old school chap caught in the midst of the dematerialized but no less obstructive (and destructive) bureaucracy,Watching poor Daniel entrapped in the pervert mechanisms of a system that deems him able to work and trying to claim his rights to office workers who remain deaf and blind to his explanations is painful to watch, but it's a cathartic experience nonetheless. We know we're not alone for as long as directors like Ken Loach will shed light on average people promised to a slow downfall because of bureaucratic technicalities, cinema will preserve its nobility. While Hollywood is busy making films about superheroes, here's a touching and minimalist drama that illustrates with the simple language of the camera the struggles of the little people, the forgotten entities of the liberal dream without drowning the material in an ocean of pathos.Indeed, Daniel is constantly active, he tries to reason his interviewers, the security guards, he learns how to use the Internet, and later, we see him helping Kathy, a single mother with two kids by fixing plumbery, crafting and simply making his presence indispensable. He's the handy man and the father-figure a house needs. His obstacle-course of a life allows us to discover the struggle of single mothers. Played by Hailey Squires, Kathy couldn't get her family allowances because she missed the bus and therefore her appointment. trying we also have a glimpse on the fate of a woman who can't get her allocations because she came late, Like Daniel, no one listens to her. Still, there's one worked played by Kate Rutter who restores our faith. They're not all heartless robots repeating the same mechanical shticks, but for her efforts to assist Daniel, her boss tells her off for setting a dangerous precedent. So much for the light of hope.This is not a neutral film, obviously, it's a powerful ""J'Accuse"" against the system and it's Ken Loach after all. But Loach and screenwriter Paul Laverty did their homework before starting shooting, collecting as many items of confidences to build their story. A man losing his disability pension because of a seizure during a meeting, another sanctioned for missing an appointment because of his father's funeral, hardly what Daniel and Kathy went through. Indeed, reality is as surrealistic as Asterix' ""House That Sends You Mad"". But you might lose a little more than your marbles here, money, dignity, life, you name them. Loach deliberately didn't chose a handicapped person because the case would be 'too' obvious, he picked two healthy-looking people to make their case more administratively ambiguous. From our POV, they're responsible enough, which makes their breakdowns more difficult to watch.So we get some harrowing moments such as Kathy opening a tin of beans in the Food Bank (an episode that would earn her daughter mockeries from her schoolmates), we see her shoplifting and almost pushed into the worst possible scenario job-wise and meanwhile Daniel is only forced to trick the system and asks for unemployment benefits. The catch is that he's got to endure these training sessions where they lecture you about these magical 'ten seconds' (and boy, I went through that), he gets insults from a man who genuinely wanted to hire and learned that he only did that to get allowance, and on the phone, Daniel can't even articulate a reason ... too rational to swallow the only medicine he can get. The closest to comedy is the running gag of the phone calls where you've got to endure Vivaldi for hours (again so true to life) and the ultimate breakdown moment where Daniel makes a temporary buzz by tagging his protest on a wall and even mention the music.That scene isn't shown like a triumph but the last burst of rebellious dignity from a man who always kept a low profile and tried to live normally in that world of nonsense. I wouldn't spoil what goes after that scene but in totally unglamorous and un-Dickensian fashion, that fits the depiction of the paupers' lives in Newcastle, Loach provides an extraordinary depiction of a system that is far sneakier than a real movie villain and that contaminated every town of the civilized world. The nightmares of job centers, these places where unemployed people must regularly register, wondering inside how come the people who work there have that job. And Loach reveals that some workers did tell them that they were forced to act that way, many felt ashamed, many didn't even stay, some were fired, which is like imagining former prison guards going to jail. I used the term ""surrealist"" but that fits the purpose of Loach who denounces the fact that these people are supposed to find jobs that don't exist and the real mockery is to make them believe that it's their fault, not enough motivation, not enough guts or a not so eye-catching resume. In the end, they're lazy, they're parasites, it's all their fault.Today, the pandemic is still going, we don't live, restaurant owners see their lifetime investments being dilapidated, but the government ensures us that it's our fault, for not respecting safety precautions. It is a tough world for the little ones, thankfully, Ken Loach is still here to defend all the Daniel Blakes, all the Kathies of the world. A well-deserved second Golden palm win!"
" Socialist tripe
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,1,"Political nonsense, dreadful acting and poor direction"
" Great social commentary
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,9,"This film is an accurate insight into the current benefit system, operating in the UK.
The outsourcing and budget cutting in public services, has resulted in a complete breaching of claimants human rights. The right to privacy, autonomy and respect.
The only thing I will say, is that this film could lead to the removal rather than a restructuring, of the benefit system. That would be truly awful."
" Very well act outstanding
",2021-01-15 00:00:00,9,"I believe It's close to la miserable novel .
And highly recommended for someone who believe to feel the injustice community."
" Tritely
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,2,"Take the Knut Hamsun's ""Hunger"",
mix it with Akaky from Gogol's ""Overcoat"",
add Sonia from Dostoevsky's ""Crime and Punishment""."
" Only rated so high because political
",2020-12-21 00:00:00,4,"The acting is noticeably subpar, the story is predictable and the script very immature. Feels like a B movie.
People only rate this so high because they agree with the sentiment of the film, a charge against UK bureaucracy."
" 10/10 all day
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,10,"Brilliant film, well worth spending the time to watch. I can honestly say I have never shed a tear over any other film than this ever. This could have a universal message but being British it really hit a spot due to my political views. Excellent."
" Attack on the heart
",2020-11-28 00:00:00,9,"Whether Loach is concocting vitamins or poisons seems to vary wildly from viewer to viewer. It might help to consider the fact this film tells ""a"" story as opposed to ""the"" story.As such pitting the failings of an increasingly corporate body of government pitched vs the feeble human body of citizen Blake, one will always fear the outcome might well be : the operation was a success, but the patient died.The story doesn't just rest on its significant anti-bureaucracy everyman-as-underdog laurels though, the charisma of Dave Johns as Daniel Blake keeps the film alive. Mix in compassion received and bestowed by him and that's the not-so-secret antidote proposed. A dose of humanity prescribed. Will it be delivered in time?And not just between the accidental family that springs up between Blake and the single-mother with two kids. Strangers in the library, the neighbor ""China"" trying to out scheme the brand-name schemers, and I'd add especially the woman at services office (was it Ann or Claire, I remember she had a name-tag and tried to be more than that with both water on visit and some screen access the other).Scenes at the food pantry and with the employment search definitely tough pills to swallow no matter what you think it is, but those scenes of compassion of striving to treat another with dignity, I think that's the simple message here, not easily filled out in triplicate.Anyways a fine film."
" Working class hero
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,9,"A powerful movie about the struggles of decent ordinary people, in a world which says it is your fault if you didn't make it."
" Industrialization was the beginning of the end, bureaucracy was the middle of the end.
",2020-09-15 00:00:00,7,"The ending is a little trite, along with Daniel's selfless helping of a single mother thrust into prostitution (after a well constructed emotional gut-punch of a scene in a food bank). Why does his speech have to say that he wants to be treated like a man and not like a dog? Why can't people also try to be nicer to dogs?"

" I cried. Then I cried. Finally, I cried some more.
",2020-03-06 00:00:00,10,"I didn't expect this film to move me this much. Even the most simple thing, Daniel drawing on the wall, made me want to give him my coat. The ending was heartbreaking, but inspiring. Great depiction of the ""great"" country of Britain, crumbling like Vesuvius."
" A CALL TO REVOLUTION
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,10,"Daniel: biblical hero who stood by his beliefs in the face of persecution and prevailed.Blake: visionary poet who spoke out against the exploitation of working people by the State, in league with the Church."
" The last will be the last
",2020-02-10 00:00:00,8,"Dan Blake is an honest citizen, trying to get some support from society, after having suffered a heart-attack.Despite being seriously ill, he is at risk of loosing his benefits due to bureaucratic complications. It does not help that he is 59 and not very computer-literate, in a time and age when every form must be filled in online.Dan is a cheerful friendly fellow and during his own quest he even finds the time to help a young single mother, also in the process of being crushed by poverty and bureaucracy.This is a realistic tale of problems faced every day by the lower class, even in the richest societies. It is not a gloomy one, though.The style is almost fake documentary, with minimal music and no stylish frills, but the actors are so good and the plot so compelling as to make this a truly moving, memorable movie."
" Truly powerful movie
",2020-01-30 00:00:00,10,"I found the film to be a surprise. I did not expect to feel that emotional when watching. Maybe because I did no research before watching, but also because it took such a real approach when capturing the life of the characters. It is definitely one of the best movies I have because of how natural the setting is. There is not always a happy end for most people and that's the truth."
" A man's struggle and suffering portrayed convincingly
",2020-01-02 00:00:00,10,"An honest and heart-wrenching film made by the renowned English director Ken Loach. He won the Palme d'Or in Cannes Film Festival for this movie and it also won the BAFTA for Outstanding British Film of the Year. It is one of the best films that came out in 2016. In my opinion, it deserved all the praise it received cause it affected me on a personal level and the feeling stayed for several days. Lots of research was done by the director and screenwriter Paul Laverty, his longtime collaborator before filming began. They interviewed people who worked in the Department of Work and Pensions as well as the beneficiaries and incorporated their experiences.A man, suffering under the system and being denied his rights. I thought these types of things only happened in my country, but disappointingly this problem is everywhere. The director presents the starkly realistic struggle of a carpenter, Daniel Blake (Dave Johns), applying for support allowance. He befriends a single mother, Katie (Hayley Squires), with two kids also struggling due to the faulty state system. We see their friendship develop and helping each other through difficult situations, but the hope for justice proves futile.The characters, the acting, and the dialogues are so realistic that it resembles a documentary rather than a film. The acting by the actors is nothing short of brilliant. Dave Johns's portrayal of a proud, honest and compassionate character is one of the best, and I sympathized with his predicament. I clapped for him while watching an act of rebelliousness by him. The direction is pure and Ken Loach's talent for creating emotional moments is praiseworthy.The screenplay by Paul Laverty is original and avoids unnecessary cliches. The colors have a tinge of gray representing the cold-hearted world. The film elicits genuine sympathy for the characters and does not cheat our emotions by using sentimental music, in fact, there is no background score at all. The actors do the hard job of making us feel emotionally drenched. It is a movie that needs to be seen at least once."
" No escapism here
",2019-12-26 00:00:00,8,A brilliant film that captures the futility and absurdity of modern day bureaucracy for those who have fallen off the tracks and into their orbit. It doesn't gloss over it. It doesn't pretend there's a silver lining and it kind let's you feel the slow grind it is. It's sobering.
" It hit the nail on the head!
",2019-11-22 00:00:00,8,"I love these kinds of movies. It's all about ""REAL"" life. A life that's sad, unfortunately true and not fair. The relationship with Dan and Katie is a tale about two people hitting hard times, and being there of each other. It's endearing and heartfelt. However, they struggle for the basics to survive, that shouldn't exist today. It's a wake-up call for everyone to help your own communities, give what you can and donate to the local food banks. It's a great movie about two unlikely people coming together in dark times, and form a loving bond. This movie is a must see!"
" Outstanding
",2019-11-13 00:00:00,10,"This is a completely heartbreaking, but a very realistic look on Britain today. If you have never watched it you should. I'm speechless."
" A double bill of I, Daniel Blake (2016) and Sorry We Missed You (2019)
",2019-11-08 00:00:00,8,"""Daniel's quagmire is plain and simple, but those functionaries occupying a place in the bureaucratic hierarchy keep winking at it (save a sympathetic one who sticks her neck out for him once, only to be taken to task by her superior in the next breath), exerting bureaucratese to muddy the waters and shunting him through futile red tapes, and Loach selects a perfect boiling point to show us why the film is titled ""I, DANILE BLAKE"", and just when ray of sunshine seems to materialize as Daniel seeks legal resort to right his wrong, his chapter ends abruptly. It is Katie Morgan (Squires), a young single mother with whom he befriends, pays a tribute to him using his own unuttered words in the coda, Loach's scalpel-like censure cuts with superb precision and gravitas....""""""Misery loves company"" is the operative word in the follow-up, SORRY WE MISSED YOU, shot with almost the same team behind the camera (writer, cinematography, musician etc.), here, one nuclear family is under the spotlight, Ricky Turner (Hitchen) enlists as a courier for a large corporate, investing in a new van for his daily delivery routines, his wife Abby (Honeywood) is a caretaker for the disabled and the elderly, together they have two school-age children, Seb (Stone) and Lisa Jane (Proctor).....""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks"
" What a lost opportunity!
",2019-10-31 00:00:00,3,"I should like 'I Daniel Blake'. As an educated but proudly working class liberal, the message should resonate and move me, but the film left me with strong feelings of disappointment and lost opportunities, not about the subject but about the film. Firstly, there is a distinct reluctance to portray the central characters as ordinary working class. I can understand the reticence in perhaps following old clichés in relation to the working class - as we are often unfairly portrayed as caricatures and overwhelmingly uneducated. However, the portrayal of the central characters as having hidden talents or aspirations of higher education are clumsy and patronising and not a little cynical. I felt the film was appealing to the affluent middle class liberal and that their affection for the characters could not be garnered without the addition of this extra potential. I would have found the story a lot more believable if the characters had been far more ordinary, who just survive without the fall-back option of bettering themselves with Open University aspirations. Also, Daniel's obvious artistic talents make it unlikely that he would need to sell his furniture to survive. My main annoyance at the film however is the broad strokes it takes with the storyline - the employees at the various government agencies are portrayed as almost universally heartless. Having experience of unemployment and dealing with these kinds of people, this is not my experience. Also, the oldest cliché in the book, of the mother having no choice but to go into prostitution was the final straw for me. It was not a little patronising and insulting to me as a woman to portray this as a natural progression. In short, I was ready to love this film, but it is clumsy, cliché ridden and only appeals to those having an isolated affection for the working class and does the subject matter (which deserves proper attention) no favours whatsoever."
" Dan's Labyrinth
",2019-10-16 00:00:00,7,"Ken Loach must finally be mellowing, since we actually get only occasional glimpses of the relentless Kafkaesque nightmare that is negotiating Britain's benefit system in the 21st Century.In his determination to humanise his central characters Loach devotes far too much time to Daniel Blake's resilience, good humour, and friendship with Katie (whose story provides more than sufficient material for a separate movie of her own; and as a pretty but vulnerable young woman the film graphically demonstrates is prey to even more insidious forms of abuse in her own right), and remarkably little to the profligate amount of time squandered on negotiating the intractable bureaucratic maze of form-filling, queuing and listening to Vivaldi that blights the lives of him and countless others.Overworked, badly-paid drones impatiently tell Daniel to ""Just Listen!!"" while never actually listening to HIM; and those who deviate from the script by attempting to be sympathetic or helpful can expect immediately to be pounced upon and upbraided by their managers for wasting time. But we only fleetingly see chores like the 9 a.m. CV preparation class whose true function is just to provide yet another hoop for him to jump through; and we never see the endless hours spent on public transport during the rush hour getting to and from these mischievously time-consuming impositions (invariably scheduled first thing in the morning, and woe betide anyone who shows up late)."
" A very powerful snapshot of our system
",2019-09-15 00:00:00,10,"This is a great movie, it's fast, and confrontational, the writer did the research very well to understand the growing number of people that fall between the gaps and how cold the very system that Daniel Blake paid each week to protect him. When in need, did just the opposite.
This snapshot of reality, I found very raw. It's a story that is overdue. You watch this movie and you ask yourself why do we allow and accept the system the fail the people in need.
I found this powerful story, with a true but a sad theme of life.
If nothing else, you do a lot of thinking about the system that we all seem to accept, but powerless to do something about it."
" Daniel Blake is the person that the system fails
",2019-09-15 00:00:00,10,This is really a snapshot of the system that is supposed to support us when in need
" Wow. What a load of utter nonsense.
",2019-08-17 00:00:00,1,"I was fully expecting his ghost to come back at the end or maybe the jobcentre adviser to unzip their skin suit to reveal it was E.T.
Do feel it was strange that he was so determined he was too sick to work and demonstrated this by carrying out repairs for Katie while making toys for the kids. If only there were jobs repairing or making things this whole ending could have been avoided.
Sure the writer and producers thought they were doing something really smart in highlighting the plight of the downtrodden but i suspect this has hurt more than it helped as some gullible people will believe this is what its really like and not apply for the help they needed"
" Almost watchable
",2019-07-31 00:00:00,4,First I tuned on CC as I had a hard time understanding the accent. It seems like there is some potential here but I just ran out of patience
" Its message is good, but the movie is a chore
",2019-07-25 00:00:00,5,"I agree with the politics and the moral sentiments of this film wholeheartedly, but the film itself is rather mediocre. It seems ironic to me that this is the kind of fare that could only be appreciated by festivalgoers and the attendees of prestigious art cinemas--people who, on average, have expendable incomes far surpassing those of the characters populating the film. I grew up in poverty and on welfare; nobody in my family would have ever spent their precious free time watching something as tedious as this.The general lack of verisimilitude in the performances is perhaps what made it such a slog for me. Most of the non-professional bit actors--even though they're just supposed to be garden variety social workers, security guards, and such saying fairly commonplace things--seem like they're reading from a script overloaded with symbolic messaging. There's nothing more boring to me than cinéma-vérité that can't quite nail the vérité part. I'd rather just watch a documentary; a real social worker doing her job is far more interesting to watch than a bad actor pretending to be one, even if they're technically saying and doing the same things. Dave Johns, in what I gather is his first real dramatic role (I'm American and have never seen him before, but I gather he's well-known as a stand-up comedian in England), seems like he's reading lines from a page most of the time, trying his hardest to avoid looking at the camera. Hayley Squires is decent, even if her character is a cliche from a nineteenth century naturalistic novel, and the two young actors who play her kids are also quite convincing, but that's about it.It was far too on-the-nose, predictable, saccharine, and tedious for my taste. Its heart is in the right place, but a documentary film or a decent long-form magazine article would have probably succeeded better at engaging me in the issues."
" Ham-fisted and biased
",2019-07-24 00:00:00,3,"My title says it all really. This is just such a one sided piece with no subtlety. Basically the message is all benefit claimants good, all DSS bad. I found it nauseating in its simplistic manner."
" What a good film and striking final!!
",2019-07-08 00:00:00,9,"Ken Loach is known as the director of working class films. He leads his camera on all kinds of defections of modern life and capitalist states.
I, Daniel Blake is a striking story of an old worker metaphorizing all workers exposed desperation. This is a picture of what happens and will go on happenning in the life of all us unless we can get together for basic human rights.
Daniel Blake, a good man, shouts out us; ""Don't go on listening the music for response of call centers. Close the phone, and write your name on a wall!!""
I couldn't leave my seat for half an hour after the movie.
Thank you Ken Loach, greetings to all Daniel Blakes."

" A depressing look at bureaucracy and the social saftey net
",2019-05-06 00:00:00,9,A sad commentary on how the working poor who fall on hard times through no fault of their own are treated by the government bureaucracy. The picture of the safety net bureaucracy is one that shows that the government program seems to exist more for the purpose of salving the conscience of the better offs and providing paychecks for the bureaucrats themselves rather than helping those in need. I think even the U.S. is better than this. But then maybe not.
" Hard to watch
",2019-05-01 00:00:00,9,"Many reviews have already covered what this film is about, and have presented facts and opinions regarding the system, so I won't repeat all that. Instead, I just want to say that this was a very hard film to watch. It is a difficult emotional journey, watching Katie and Dan as they both try to hold on to their dignity. They are both hard working lovely people with good hearts, just trying to find work and in Katie's case, feed a family. It made me sick in my soul to see how they are treated in so many places, how unbending the system is. And then, the people that do help like the shop owner, the sneaker neighbor and the kind people in the food bank, they nourish your soul back again. It's just hard. The embarrassment and humility. I don't think this is the average person in the system in the UK, but I think even if it's only 10% of the people, it's far too many. I know this film isn't for everybody. It's difficult subject matter presented in a linear way. The acting is incredible. Some of the most brilliant delivery, of the most heart wrenching common-man dialogue. The scenes/sets, direction, script - it's all bloody brilliant in the most relatable accessible of ways. This is a champion job for the every man."

" A Truly Excellent Piece Of Film
",2019-04-10 00:00:00,9,"I have watched hundreds of films, but I this is the first film where I have felt compelled to leave a review. Being from Newcastle myself, I see problems like this on a daily basis and the portrayal of the characters and setting is very realistic. The film truly shows and exposes the unfairness and the cruelty of the benefits system. You really feel for the characters and their situations, like when Katie is in the foodbank, and you can really relate to them on an emotional level. The film is really worth all 9 stars."
" A Good Closing Note for Me
",2019-03-15 00:00:00,8,"I have been actively working my way through the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die lists, and of all the movies on all the lists, this was the final one. Melancholy, absolutely, but I am happy to end the list on a quality note."

I'm the biggest lefty going but this is let down by poor acting (wooden) and unbelievable characters.I get what Loach is trying to do, but it falls completely flat."
" Subdued subduing
",2019-02-04 00:00:00,3,"Strangely unaffecting (given all the hype).I've been much more affected by the various press reports of seriously ill people who have died while waiting to challenge an assessment which claimed they were fit to work.Perhaps this would have worked better if it had been (even) more Kafkaesque?I guess this was, inevitably, going to go one of two ways: either the system would be shown to be irredeemably corrupt, or there would be seen to be some (small) light at the end of the tunnel. I think the filmmakers made the wrong choice of ending."
" Remarkable and essential.
",2019-01-31 00:00:00,9,"British director Ken Loach isn't known for politically subtle films; his stories are ones which grounded in one political worldview, promoting and expounding it from a variety of angels. That's not to say he's necessarily heavy-handed; but he runs that risk on occasions. Approaching this film, aware that it was his state of the (British) nation address from the point of view of people lost in a labyrinthine benefits system, I was expecting something I would be naturally sympathetic to but possibly alienated from due to what I expected to be broad-brush strokes. I was wrong; it's Loach's most nuanced and delicate film, telling a simple story with slowly simmering rage. A widowed man is signed off sick from work due to a heart condition; as he attempts to claim the benefits he needs he befriends a single mother and her children as they too seek the support the state should be giving them. Though the script is compelling, the real strength of the film is in its silences and counterpoints; the personal care of the food bank volunteers against the largely dispassionate, impersonal government employees. This results in the films most moving scene - a visit to a food bank where a combination of hunger and receiving compassion tip a desperate, nearly crushed woman in to an act of quiet desperation that's heartbreaking to watch. It's to the film's immense credit that it doesn't drift into anti-climax afterwards; yet neither is there a cheap, easy victory or moment of false hope. Hope is there, but it walks a vulnerable line of being extinguished by the system designed to serve the very people lost under the weight rules and regulations. It's a story of the people who fall through the cracks; it reminded me of Dickens' urgent, prophetic tales of urban poverty and never ending legal wranglings - and the film does not suffer from such lofty comparison. We're left asking: do we contribute to such systems' oppression and suffering, or do we seek out those who are lost, sit with them, listen to them, walk with them? It's a film of difficult questions and few answers; but that is moving, satisfying, funny and eloquent for all that."
" A test that anybody who's ill can fail
",2019-01-24 00:00:00,10,"Ken Loach's film of Paul Laverty's screenplay shows a telling and painful story of governmental abuse of the temporarily unwell. By mistreating and undermining the noble spirit and unshakeable good faith of Daniel Blake (Dave Johns), we see the malign bureaucracy claiming another avoidable fatality."

",2019-01-15 00:00:00,9,"Every Tory and Republican should be made to watch this film if necessary a la A Clockwork Orange, ie strapped to a seat with their eyes pinned open. This is what being poor is like. Your dignity unstintingly wrenched at every day. The heartwarming part of the film is that Daniel keeps his dignity. I have only watched it once but l know the story at every turn. Always the sign of a top quality movie."
" Heartwrenching, striking and ultimately real
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,10,"I have never given a film a 10 on this website. A 10 would imply perfection and that should not exist. About an hour into I, Daniel Blake I paused the film and said that it was flawless, by the end I had some tiny quibbles that would make it a 9.5 if I had my nastiest, most quibble-orientated, pedantic critic hat on. IMDB does not allow fractional star scores, it deserved the 10.The performances by David Johns and Hayley Squires are magnificent, the screenwriting by Paul Laverty is wonderful. The film pulls you in, absorbs you and refuses to allow you to look away. The brilliance is not that it is harrowing, not that it shocks or sickens, it is that it's relateable.I'm reminded of Requiem for a Dream, a film that grips by the sheer horror that it depicts, but in I, Daniel Blake there is no horror of the abstract, every character could be someone you walk past on the street on any day of your life. The gut punch comes from the fact there is no gut punch, the normality is infinitely stronger.This film is beautiful, tragic, desperate, funny and ultimately speaks to people trying to live their lives. Instead of continuing to gush all I will say is watch this, you will have no regrets."
" Daniel Blake gives up paid work for voluntary work...
",2019-01-11 00:00:00,6,...he's a skilled carpenter who suffers a heart attack and is recovering while taking drugs to prevent a further attack. Instead of asking for light duties he leaves paid employment to help a neighbor by working as a handyman doing up their council house.Gradually he grapples with computers and the digital world that was passing him by and puts together his CV that is good enough to earn him a job interview but he turns it down!Meanwhile the neighbor he is helping is starving herself to share the family's food with Daniel. She is leafleting her neighborhood for cleaning work but Dan is not selling his handyman or carpentry skills to earn some much needed cash.Meanwhile the DWP's digital bureaucracy grinds exceedingly fine with rules that must be obeyed for claimants fulfilling their personal commitments to receive welfare benefits and to avoid sanction.Unused to such discipline and computers Dan is sucked down into a spiral of despair.The film had me screaming at the TV for Dan to sell his handyman services while continuing to help his neighbor. At no time did he stop work but he simply didn't take control of his life.I guess that I was meant to feel sorry for him but I couldn't.
" Powerful realism
",2019-01-09 00:00:00,10,"Very powerful, beautifully directed British film. It's realism and subtle storytelling is exceptional. It's a heartbreaking yet heartwarming. A great work."
" Must watch
",2019-01-09 00:00:00,10,"I never caught this film when it was out but watched it now in January 2018 as Britain is obsessed with the upcoming Brexit. Whether a Remainer or a Brexiteer, all to many British people are distracted from the real struggle of day to day life. This film sums those striggles up in a very poignant way, focusing on one man's struggle for his rights. John's performance is magnificent, showing how real people everyday are affected by the ludicrous policies of a government who themselves are never affected. Thus is real, this is gritty. This should be shown to every government worker as part of their training - PEOPLE MATTER."
" Sadly important
",2019-01-08 00:00:00,8,"We all hate it when we are treated according to a standardised procedure, with no discretion shown for our particular circumstances. Perhaps it's inevitable that a benefits system is impersonal; but perhaps it's rather a feature by design, to strip applicants of their dignity, either to deter scroungers or simply to drive down the bill by making it humiliating, and difficult, to get what you really need. In the U.K., it has for a long time been widely suspected that some people claim invalidity benefits when actually fit to work; but attempts to prevent this have led to cries of outrage that the sick are sometimes basically left to fend for themselves, forced to seek jobs they are not fit to take. Ken Loach's film 'I, Daniel Blake', is fictional, but it's grounded in many credible accounts of how the system works.The film itself is minimalistic, without any soundtrack; it's low key, showing us the everyday reality of Daniel's life. But it makes one angry watching it, because one can easily believe that for many people, this is exactly how the system presents itself. You couldn't call the film fun to watch, but it's important: every time you hear politicians lambast scroungers, you need to consider what the counter measures mean for those without a support network. Sadly, this is a must see movie."
" True grit
",2019-01-07 00:00:00,8,"This isn't about blockbusters and overpaid bad actors ( Ferrell,Hanks,Cruise,DeNiro) etc..it's about the real world of movie making.We could have had 20 or 30 of these for the price of a ridiculous Xmen or Star Bores.Brilliantly directed and acted with the slowest burning narrative it does just enough to slowly boil your blood.Watching this in 2019 amidst the immigration crisis makes it even more searing and cements the fact that the government has no time for it's own ,,instead preferring to hand out cash to others.Mesmerising to anybody who has ever been hungry in a hopeless situation."
" Claim and shame
",2019-01-07 00:00:00,3,"Ken Loach continues his drama documentary style of filmmaking, five decades after Cathy Come Home. Both that and I Daniel Blake was made or co-produced by the BBC.The film is a flawed polemic, a challenge to the Tory government's continuing austerity policies.Daniel Blake is a carpenter who has suffered a heart attack. His doctor has signed him off work. However he cannot get disability benefits because an assessor deems him fit to work.Daniel tries to get through the benefits system such as applying for Jobseekers Allowance, appeal for his disability support refusal but he cannot get to grips with IT and apply for the benefits online.Daniel looks for work to keep the Benefits Agency happy. He knows he is not fit to work if he is ever offered a job. The odd person at the benefits agency try to help out but Daniel is lost.He befriends a single mother Katie who has been sent up to Newcastle from London. She is also struggling to claim benefits. Daniel helps her with some DIY in her new accommodation, he takes her to the food bank.I found this to be an infuriatingly flawed film. Like some middle class person's version of how the underclass survive. So you get the odd bit of shoplifting and being forced into prostitution.For a previous job, I had training on welfare benefits. I helped people out to fill forms, even do benefit appeals. It was not my main job, I just needed to know enough and signpost claimants to the right people who could help them. It is a case of knowing how to fill the forms and there are people out there who know how to do it.Maybe Daniel Blake has worked his whole life and does not understand the benefits system as he never had to claim it. The last people you go to for help is the staff at the Benefits Agency. I just could not fathom how he could not find or someone could just nudge him to the Welfare Rights Service, they do have one in Newcastle. They would had helped him to complete the forms.The film just had a hollowness about it and I liked Cathy Come Home, a drama that was made before I was even born. This is a slice of 'it's grim up north' and it rang false.I, Daniel Blake was the first British film since The Mission in 1986 to win The Palme d'Or. You cannot find two contrasting films even though both tried to tell stories about the human condition."
" The system is broken. Only a revolution can fix it.
",2019-01-06 00:00:00,10,"We constantly send our system work overseas. People overseas have no idea about why certain things happen in certain way in our country. As a result, we get systems that are not fit for purpose.Add to that, we have a government that is completely out of touch with reality. The government wants to actually destroy the lives of people.People in full-time jobs are having to go to food-banks.Schools not having enough budget to teach kids properly.NHS has not enough budget and sky-high targets.Where are we heading?This film is just a small glimpse into the reality which is absolute hell for so many."
" Powerful stuff
",2019-01-06 00:00:00,6,"I Daniel Blake.... emotionally powerful stuff , glad that there are films made to convey the inequality in society. On the other hand I think Ken Loach goes through all the cliches in the book in this one .... its tough up North, we'll get through it pet with our wit and banter go fu** the-man."
" Marvellous..

" Fight the System!
",2019-01-03 00:00:00,5,"My Rating : 5/10This movie will get to your heart. It shows the life of ordinary people who've been dealt a bad hand - from life, from people around them and the government systems.I don't know about whether you call this socialist propaganda. It's just about how bureaucratic governments are at the expense of efficiency and common sense. A simple film."
" Exposes govt systems unwillingness.

Lost value for respect and humanity in front of money.Heart touching film in terms of showing the human relationship and hence must watch for people who like movies with content.Finally standing for each other in difficult circumstances is all that matters.
" Floods of tears
",2018-10-20 00:00:00,10,"I Daniel Blake. Wow. I spent 1/3 of the film laughing, 1/3 of the film angry and 1/3 of the film in floods of tears. Can't believe I'm saying this but Ken Loach's best. The scene in the food bank will stay with me forever. After the film, I'm angry. I'm sad. I'm happy. Corbyn would approve (not of the system, but the film let it be noted). Ten out of ten. In the words of Ken Loach, if this film doesn't affect you or anger you, what sort of person are you?"
" Deeply moving
",2018-10-04 00:00:00,10,"Went into this movie thinking that it might be interesting, but not really expecting much. I found an incredibly moving film which made me feel close to the characters throughout, I definitely don't regret watching it."
" It's very well made for it is.
",2018-09-26 00:00:00,6,"I would be lying if I said I liked this movie in the conventional way because it is really just a problem picture albeit a well-made one. It feels like it should just be a TV movie, but it makes all its points impeccably: the issues of the system and how even when we have welfare it can be structured against the people it's supposed to help. It reminded me in parts of The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists except without the political sermons. Obviously, a political movie but it focused on just telling a story with believable, likable characters with a great sense of humour and pathos to lace its hard-edged reality.If you're looking for a socially conscious picture with fine acting from both our veteran protagonist and a super cute biracial girl then you could hardly do better."
" Excellent film about a man being strangled by bureaucratic red tape
",2018-09-25 00:00:00,9,"I, Daniel Blake (2016) was directed by Ken Loach. It stars Dave Johns as Daniel Blake, and Hayley Squires, a down-and-out single mom who is befriended by Blake.As the movie opens, we learn that Blake has suffered a heart attack. His doctor tells him that he'll be OK, but he can't work at his job as a carpenter for a while yet.Automatic disability, right? Wrong. Blakes runs afoul of the person who ""scores"" disability. In an unethical (and maybe unlawful) act, she declares that he's not temporarily disabled.The plot takes off from there. It's not an easy movie to watch. In fact, it's hard to take when you see a decent man being beaten down by bureaucracy. However, it's an important film to see, even if it makes you uncomfortable. This movie was shown at Rochester's wonderful Dryden Theatre as part of the excellent Rochester Labor Film Series. It will work well on the small screen. I, Daniel Blake has a very strong IMDb rating of 7.9. I think it's even better than that."

" Fearlessly hard hitting
",2018-08-25 00:00:00,8,"'I, Daniel Blake' was highly recommended to me by a close relative, she having found it very insightful and moving if very on the nose. Actually watched it a few weeks ago with family, it has just taken me a while to get round to reviewing it with so much to see and review, with such a long watch and review list that keeps getting longer, and also a lot going on in my life.Am truly thankful for the recommendation, as it was the above (insightful and moving as well as honest, parts hitting hard and home with me) on all counts. 'I, Daniel Blake' to me, and many others, was a very good film, nearly great as a matter of fact. It may not be for all tastes, like Ken Loach himself, and it is understandable why its depiction of the Jobcentre system especially was controversial. Is it perfect? No, of course not. Are there many good things? Absolutely. Are they big? Yes, very.There is no doubt that 'I, Daniel Blake' is a hard-hitting film. It certainly hit me hard and some of it hit home with me, having been there with a couple of the situations myself. It is admittedly not a subtle film, it is very on the nose and there are times where it does go too far. The Jobcentre/social worker people could have been painted in a more sympathetic and less exaggerated light seeing as it is the system that's heavily flawed (was in the situation once, and it was not a happy experience, actually incredibly stressful, at all) not them. It was the latter that was clearly intended, it just felt a little heavy handed.For me, the ending was also somewhat abrupt and almost like a cheat, like they were trying to shy away from ending the film on too pat a note, and it was a situation that one does sort of foresee but doesn't want to happen. Katie's final scene is certainly poignant, but somehow the ending didn't wholly satisfy.However, 'I, Daniel Blake' is visually slick and suitably gritty, to match the seriousness of what's being depicted. The music is wisely not constant and is quite understated, George Fenton can be the stirring and sweeping, as well as hauntingly beautiful, sort of composer so it was nice to hear something different.On top of that, 'I, Daniel Blake' is thoughtfully and honestly scripted, with a few gently humorous touches, constant realism and parts that resonate emotionally, found myself agreeing often with what Daniel says. The story raises many issues, important and relevant but also difficult ones, how it depicts them is as said not always subtle and very on the nose but it's done in a way that is realistic, makes one think hard after it's over, it's insightful, is admirably fearless in its approach and makes one identify completely with Daniel and Katie. There is emotional impact here, like at the food bank and Katie's final scene. They are very much compellingly real and instantly rootable and one wants them to succeed and overcome their adversity, their relationship is very touching and charming.Loach directs with confidence and experience and he gets terrific lead performances from Dave Johns and Hayley Squires. Johns is in a more dramatic role and gives intensity and emotional power to it, fully succeeding in making Daniel relatable. Squires very movingly portrays a struggling single mother, in a way that any single parents with struggles will find themselves in.Overall, very good. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
" Just too damn real.
",2018-07-22 00:00:00,10,"Back home I watched ""I, Daniel Blake"". Quite a different film from the impression created by the trailer. In the trailer, you're shown all the upbeat stand-fast rebellious moments; you're given the feeling this plucky little man will prevail. In the film, you experience the grinding soul-devastating hopelessness of desperate poverty through the eyes of a good simple man suddenly at the mercy of a bureaucracy that's forgotten how to care. An excellent film with fine performances by Dave Johns & Hayley Squires, but not one I ever want to watch again. Just too damn real."
" Roach Loach
",2018-05-13 00:00:00,1,"Got misty-eyed and heart-sore. Movie was very good at pulling at my heartstrings. But then, when it was over, when I had time to reflect and collect myself, I realized I had been used, abused and manipulated by a shrewd, Marxist ideologue, Ken Loach, the Roach. Daniel Blake was not a doomed loser. He had marketable skills, which should have given him the ability to determine his own future and independence. In the US he wouldn't have been at the mercy of the grim, grey UK welfare state. In the US he could have made a living with his hands, by being a self-employed fix-it man and/or craftsman of furniture and wood mobiles. He could have set up shop in his garage, not been buried under forms and denied his dignity. He might have listened to Merle Haggard or Lynyrd Skynyrd, not some doomy, gloomy crap on a cassette. No such optimism, individualism or self-reliance is allowed under the Queen or House of Lords, according to Commie Ken. Roach Loach is the problem, not the solution. He is the cause of human misery, not its cure. His far-left Marxism crushes the human spirit and makes us all victims, not heroes. When will we learn? His socialist ideology has failed over and over throughout the 20th century (USSR, China, Cuba, Venezuela, ad nauseam.) The answer is not reform of the welfare state, but its abolition. The answer is to empower humans, not enslave them to government. The sun has set on the British Empire. It deserves no pity, just contempt."
" Hard Hitting
",2018-05-02 00:00:00,9,"I watched 'I Daniel Blake' and it just shocked me how much truth it portrayed. Not only in the U.K. but in other countries also. Food banks in this day and age? What a disgrace, greed and ignorance will be etched into this era. Daniel Blake captures my mood and despair trying to compete with bureaucracy after bureaucracy, paper work, online forms that crash half way through. No wonder people commit suicide, but Daniel fights back for all he's worth and befriends a young girl with two children who's also down on her luck trying to survive. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, it made me feel happy at those who cared and angry at those who didn't."
" Good film, but no subtlety
",2018-04-07 00:00:00,6,"The benefits system grinds you down. It can put you off claiming if you think you are only going to be out of work for a month or so, which is probably the intention of some people in government. So this is a worthy film to make, but the story here is heavily exaggerated. In the first half of the film every single misfortune, setback and inconvenience happens to Daniel, one after the other in a way that does not appear believe-able. He is portrayed solely as honest, warm and wholesome while the people who stand in his way are all mean, curt and heartless. Many of the characters seem artificially created or they talk in stitled dialogue to get a political message across rather than give an honest or credible account of being out of work. The film and the plot really picks up as the relationship between Daniel and Kate develops - the last 15 minutes shows how good the film could have been."
" humanity from Ken Loach
",2018-04-01 00:00:00,8,"Daniel Blake is an unemployed construction worker after a devastating heart attack. He gets disability support until a government bureaucrat decides that he doesn't have enough points. He struggles through the bureaucratic labyrinth trying to navigate a computer without the barest of rudimentary skills or applying for jobs that he couldn't take. He befriends single mom Katie who is also struggling with the bureaucracy as her support is cut.Ken Loach continues his lower class cinema with a gripping tale of a man of honor. The acting is great. The settings have a sense of real places. The plot and the turns are forseeable. For example, after Ivan gives Katie his number, the rest is a given but the emotion is never diminished. Same thing with the ending which has its inevitability. The food bank scene does take a surprising turn. Overall, this is a sad tragedy on a straight road. Daniel never loses his humanity."
" I hope this film dates quickly...
",2018-03-30 00:00:00,9,"This is all real life. It might not be an actual true story as such, but it is all still very much the truth. Anyone who has had to go through the benefit system in the UK will know how accurate this film is and, no matter how tough you think you are, it will be hard not to shed a tear when watching this film. Although not under exactly the same circumstances as Daniel Blake, I have experienced the frustrating bureaucracy of having to go to a Job Center and try to sort out benefits. I know that cripplingly humiliating feeling of being talked to like you are worthless and lazy even though you desperately want a job. Every time a bureaucratic DWP character mentioned 'The Decision Maker' it made me want to shout at my screen. I have heard those words in real life. I have dealt with those evil government robots. Special mention to a particular man who worked at the Chorlton, Manchester job center around 2011 who made me feel horrible and who couldn't even crack a smile and say well done when I finally did find work. Loads of people hated you mate and I'm sorry that your life was obviously so utterly devoid of happiness and love. (Sorry, i've gone off on one, its just that this film has brought back a lot of memories!)This film should be shown to all civil servants, government officials and definitely all politicians in the UK as a guide of how NOT to operate. I hope that one day soon we'll be able to watch I, Daniel Blake and feel glad that times have changed and people aren't experiencing the unjust struggles which this film portrays."
" Very good...
",2018-03-19 00:00:00,7,"A good look into the benefits system in place in England, and the sometimes unjust way it goes about helping people. However, it can be a little stereotypical in its view, with many being either extremely cruel or nice. There is no in between. The editing and cinematography are decent, as it uses social realist techniques. It really reflects the story and allows for the story to take centre stage. Most of the actors are quite good, and manage to give heartbreaking performances. Definitely worth a look!"
" Powerful kitchen sink drama
",2018-03-09 00:00:00,8,"Ken Loach's films have a very naturalistic style to the language and framing, which make them feel more documentary in style as there are no fancy speeches or editing. This helps make make the people seem more real, even though they are actors, and adds to the emotional impact of the situations in this film. This film is about people struggling to navigate life on the benefits system, where rules and process are more important than people being helped. The situation is farcical, if unfunny, and on more than one occasion I felt myself tearing up at the characters plight. The point is well made, but not over wrought. The actions of the people speak for themselves, and the rare touches of humanity shown by the people in the system are tellingly revealed to be flaws in how they have acted, rather than the correct response. A damning indictment of the misery inflicted on thousands to save money, whilst wealthy tax avoiders have their debts written off."
" Social production of indifference
",2018-03-02 00:00:00,10,"If people in whatever system, social, health care, education, can shit on you with impunity, because you are poor, sick, helpless, powerless, then they will, many of them. The people they are supposed to help are soon turned into enemies. It is like a mechanism. The personal, individual strength of the main characters and the relationship they build with each other is what pulls us through. Otherwise the movie would be unbearable."
" Doesn't get any more real than this
",2018-03-02 00:00:00,10,"I have put off watching this movie for ages as I just didn't think it would appeal to me. My close friends and brother have all being telling me to watch this film so here I am. 
This is powerful stuff and I mean POWERFUL STUFF. This is just so true to life. This is government BS gone nuts. This film is put together and devised by somebody who has clearly been through all this and has first hand knowledge of all the front line bureaucracy that is soul destroying. I have worked in the Employment service and have always worked as a civil servant. This film is perfect and sums up exactly how life runs. Simple story a carpenter has a heart attack and is told he can't work by his doctor but is then told he can work by the ""health professional appointed by the govermnment"". All the online computer stuff (some of which I struggle with and I know computers). The endless forms to fill in and endless waiting on the phone is just so true to life.The whole film is simply one normal bloke trying to get employment and going through a benefit system etc that is not designed to help or make life easy. I'm not going into all the details but the scene in the food bank just had me in tears. You need to watch this film. Absolute travesty that this film didn't win every oscar going. Terrific movie."
" Moving, urgent and necessary; impassioned, heart-wrenching stuff.
",2018-02-27 00:00:00,8,"'I, Daniel Blake (2016)' is an urgent and impassioned cry against the current benefits system in Britain and the budget-cuts the current government have enforced that make life for the poor almost unbearably difficult and unnecessarily bureaucratic. It's a frustrating and important ode to the seemingly unheard, unseen and uncared-for downtrodden that make up a large portion of the population and are (mostly) downright decent people. It's also a close to the bone parable that puts itself out in the open and demands to be seen, just as those it portrays demand to be treated as people rather than statistics on a screen. It really is a moving, damning and necessary piece that finds a perfect pace and reliable realism through which to convey its timely message, and it actually sneaks up on you after its credits have rolled to be much more tragic and heart-wrenching than you first realised, expertly portraying a slice-of-life so often not seen and feeling like it has a compelling reason to do so. Powerful stuff. 8/10"
" A fine film about the underclass
",2018-02-10 00:00:00,7,"In Newcastle, England, the title character (played by Dave Johns) is a widowed carpenter in his late fifties who is on the mend from a heart attack. In trying to get benefits for time off work (as recommended by his doctor), he gets stuck in a quagmire of bureaucracy. During one bad visit at a government office, he befriends Katie (Hayley Squires), an unemployed, single mother of two young children who has also been mistreated by government workers.""I, Daniel Blake"" is another courageous film by the team of director Ken Loach and screenwriter Paul Laverty that focuses, in a realistic way, on the downtrodden who are too often ignored. While this is praiseworthy, the downturn is that the overall effect can be depressing and frustrating. While the last half hour was moving in a different direction, a final plot twist thwarted this - therefore preventing the story from adding more richness to its depth.Johns and Squires are terrific in their performances as two society-rejects trying to get by and helping each other out when they can. Despite their hardships, they continue to maintain as much of their humanity as they can. Johns' appeal goes further in scenes when Daniel pokes fun at humourless nincompoops on power trips.The film has some telling (and harsh) statements of modern society and bureaucracy. There is a very noticeable contrast in how kindly the poor are treated at a food bank (run by volunteers) vs. the despicable way they are treated by government departments (run by taxpayer-funded employees). The movie has been criticized for its depiction of government employees. Among this group, there is one such character who seems to stand out as she has more soul and humanity than her peers. The film might have achieved greater depth if it had delved more into her personal story.In any case, this movie is likely to be understood by anyone has ever experienced hard times; anyone who has ever felt empathy for anyone who has experienced hard times; or anyone has ever experienced an overwhelming desire to throttle someone who is an insensitive, incompetent, arrogant, ignorant, overpaid, bureaucratic miscreant."
" I, Daniel Blake is a fantastic film that flows well with some truly solid performances.
",2018-02-08 00:00:00,9,"For more than 50 years, Ken Loach (KES) has been making films that cause us to think about our current political and social climates, no matter what race your are or where you come from, because a lot of us suffer from the same overall issues, whether it be medically, financially, or a corrupt government. Loach has never been shy to show any of these topics in his films over the years as well as in real life interviews. If you've ever attended a screening a film festival or movie where Loach is the director behind the movie, you will immediately know what you're in for, which is usually a story of someone being beat by the system, despite all of the honest and good things they do. His film I, Daniel Blake is no different, which isn't a bad thing.
It's won a ton of awards and even won the Palme d'Or award at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. The movie follows a fifty-something man named Daniel Blake who is a skilled carpenter, but is out of work due to having a heart attack. After his recovery, his doctors say he is not ready to go back to work yet, but the job assessment people say otherwise. This puts Daniel in a bad situation as employers won't hire him, because his doctors say he's unfit, but others have checked him as cleared, which leads to Daniel not getting a job and zero government assistance due to a clerical error.As he tries to fix this situation, Loach shows us the frustrating and sometimes funny series of events in trying to fix a bureaucratic mishap by being put on hold for hours on end or someone who is up there in years, trying to work a computer. After the few laughs, it really hits home as the underlying message is that we now live in a time where people are not cared for or listened to, but rather treated as cattle with no purpose. It's a system designed to leave behind the less than fortunate, but honest people. Along the way though, Daniel meets a nice woman named Katie, who has moved from here home with her kids, but is not in a good situation financially or even job-wise.Still, she does what it takes to feed her kids, even if it means she starves for days on end or has to take on other forms of employment that might be illegal. It's here that we see that despite the rough situations that both Daniel and Katie are in, they are still good human beings and help each other out when they can, because the system certainly won't. As with most Loach films, things aren't exactly happy and good feelings. What he does well here is show very realistic characters in very subtle ways with their actions and dialogue.I, Daniel Blake is a fantastic film that flows well with some truly solid performances. It not only shows certain aspects of everyday life perfectly, but also makes them relevant an connects us to one another. There are moments where things can be a bit preachy and could wander into cliche territory, but it doesn't kill the film, due to the simplistic nature and heart warming characters that are on screen. No matter how much social or political is thrown out here, the film is still a great work of art."
" Mr. Bean meets Charlie Chaplin
",2018-01-15 00:00:00,6,"This dark comedy's Daniel Blake plays the fool lost in the socialist world of the present day U.K.. Of limited intellect but a good heart, Daniel navigates the intricacies of the nanny state with little success. Ken Loach presents visible minorities as the entrepreneurial answer to an otherwise dystopian future. Will you be rolling in the aisles? Only if you can laugh at stereotypes presented by this auteur."
" I demand you treat me with respect
",2017-12-26 00:00:00,7,"When this movie won the best picture at Cannes, eyes were raised, attention sought, and interest generated. Ken Loach at 80 years still holds the fervor of activism of working class people struggling to meet ends. Ken narrates the apathy the bureaucratic system and processes inflict on a needy person through the eyes of two characters - One is Daniel Blake (played subtly by Dave Johns) and other is Katie Morgan (played by Hayley Squires.Due to heart-attack Daniel Blake is denied to do his current carpentry work, but is fit to do other odd jobs if he want subsistence allowance from government. There starts his battle with the job-center bureaucracy and here he meets Katie a single mother of two kids (girl - 9 years, boy - 7 years) who has newly arrived to New Castle and is late for the job-center interview. Daniel helps, supports, cares and gives emotional hand-holding for Katie to settle down comfortably. With no luck going in favor of either of them, Katie ends up doing a escort (prostitution) job, whereas Daniel ends up selling all his household belonging to survive - for getting two sets of meals for him.There is a also small sub-plot to lighten up the screen-time - of Daneil's neighbor China (Kena Sikazwe) who sells Chinese goods illegally.There are many outstanding dialogues and scenes that render your heart with mushy compassion for these characters. A note written by Daniel is read out in the end of the movie by Katie at his funeral ceremony, that sums up the core of the movie - the suffocating bureaucracy.:""And I swear that this lovely man, had so much more to give, and that the State drove him to an early grave.""One scene in particular needs special mention because it won the most powerful scene award for the year. It is when Katie sends her daughter to give some food to Daniel, who refuses to open the door and the girls asks him ""Dan, when you came and helped us, why can't we help you back?"" and Daniel opens the door and breaks down hugging the child. ABSOLUTELY SOUL STIRRING!There were rumors that government,might censor the movie and lots of media debates around existing pathetic government system. The movie garnered good support and appreciation from both - people and the critics respectively. It ended up doing very good business.
The relationship Daniel (60 years) and Katie (27 years) share is the best part of the movie. There is a huge age difference between the two, and they do not share romantic LOVE, but they LOVE each other deeply, and feel for each other emotionally. That humanity jumps out alive in their characters on screen.Director Ken Loach and writer Paul Laverty research a lot about the problems of people on government apathy towards the job seekers and felt this story that reflect so many people's lives needs to be told. It surely resonates...!(I would give the movie 7.5 out of 10)"
" I, Daniel Blake
",2017-12-07 00:00:00,7,"I had heard the title of this British film a few times, I knew nothing about the concept, but when it was added to the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, that gave me more reason to see it, directed by BAFTA nominated Ken Loach (Kes, Sweet Sixteen, Looking for Eric). Basically Daniel Blake (Dave Johns) is a 59-year-old widower, he works as a construction worker specialising in carpentry, he lives in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. Daniel is recovering from a recent heart attack, his cardiologist has not allowed him to return to work, but he is deemed fit to do so after a work capability assessment and denied employment and support allowance. Daniel is frustrated that his doctor was not contacted about the decision, he applies for an appeal, a process which he finds difficult as he is not computer literate and must complete forms online. At the job centre, Daniel witnesses single mother Katie (BAFTA nominated Hayley Squires) being sanctioned for arriving late for an appointment, Daniel feels sorry for Katie and befriends her. Katie and her children have recently moved from a London homeless persons' hostel to Newcastle, there is no affordable accommodation available in London. Daniel helps Katie and her family, repairing objects, teaching them how to heat rooms without electricity and crafting wooden toys for the children. Katie visits the food bank, overcome with hunger she has a break down, then she is caught at a supermarket shoplifting, the manager is prepared to let it go. At the supermarket, a security guard offers Katie job as a prostitute, she goes to the brothel, Daniel shows up there to beg her to give up the job, but she tearfully insists she has no other choice to feed her children. One of the conditions for Daniel to receive jobseeker's allowance is that he must keep looking work, he hands his CV to many places, there is an instance where he gets a call from a scrapyard, but he turns it down, mentioning his doctor and wanting to continue getting benefits, which insults the caller. Daniel attends a meeting with his work coach, but he is told that he must work harder to find a job or be sanctioned, Daniel has become frustrated with the endless, dead-end conversations over the phone with impersonal government health-care and employment agents. After leaving the job centre following another non-eventful appointment, Daniel goes to the side of the building and spray paints ""I, Daniel Blake, demand my appeal date before I starve"" in big letters on the wall. Daniel sits under the graffiti, many passing people, including other benefits claimants, show their support and praise, until he is arrested and warned by the police, following his arrest Daniel sells most of his belongings and becomes withdrawn. It is the day of Daniel's appeal, Katie accompanies him to court, a welfare adviser tells Daniel that his case looks sound, but Daniel becomes anxious when glimpsing at the judge and the doctor. In the end, Daniel visits the lavatory, where he suffers another heart attack and dies, at his funeral Katie reads the eulogy, as well as his speech he had written for the appeal, it describes Daniel's feelings about how the welfare system failed him by treating him like a dog instead of a man proud to have paid his dues to society. Also starring Dylan McKiernan as Dylan, Briana Shann as Daisy, Sharon Percy as Sheila, Kate Rutter as Ann and Kema Sikazwe as China. Johns is a comedian (he has appeared on 8 Out of 10 Cats), he makes a splendid dramatic debut, Squires is also fantastic as the single mother struggling to support her young children. The film incorporates both humour and hard-hitting issues to show the hardships of the British health and employment support systems, I myself was on jobseeker's allowance, so I know how difficult it can be and could relate with the characters, it is funny, moving and interesting, a most worthwhile comedy drama. It won the BAFTA for Outstanding British Film of the Year, and it was nominated for Best Film and Best Original Screenplay. Very good!"
" A little break from our neoliberal comfort-zone
",2017-12-05 00:00:00,7,"""I, Daniel Blake"" follows two main characters, Daniel and Katie who struggle to survive in Newcastle, Northern England, with solidarity as their only weapon. The realism of the film and the well done characters who look real and believable, make it achieve its goal.These people are not just living pictures or ghosts, and we are the next. It is a film that punches our stomach for one hour and forty minutes, introducing us to the dystopian reality of our era. A dystopia (also called TINA) that we are well trained to ignore."
" 10/10
",2017-12-01 00:00:00,9,"This is a stunning film despite the obvious political bias. Superbly acted by all it combines trenchant political criticism with folksy humor specially by the lead actor. It certainly deserves all its awards. It would have been easy to be content with simply making this a left wing polemic but the direction, to its credit, manages to make it much more than that.Worth watching.10/10"
" Loved it
",2017-11-26 00:00:00,9,"An interesting story that portrays the bare reality of today.  We can feel the other's desperation so explicit that he is.  It is a wake-up call by Ken Loach and Paul Laverty, not to forget that this is increasingly present in society.  A society that is unwilling to reach out to help those who need it, while poverty is spreading more and more to people.  It is a nightmare in which we live and even more frightening is the conformity in which people live.  All I can say is that I was disillusioned with the ending, because I thought it was unjust to die after so much fighting!"
" I, Katie would have been the better film
",2017-09-16 00:00:00,5,"There's a good film to be made about austerity Britain and the injustices of the benefits system but sadly this isn't it. I was disappointed in the rather loaded structure of this film because it discredited the messages that I think Ken Loach was trying to get across.Daniel Blake is an angry older man unjustly denied his benefit payments. What does he do? He starts off in a belligerent mood which does him no favours, he spends days moaning about how he can't use computers when the lads next door are clearly computer wizards who help him fill in the form in minutes once he gets around to asking for help. Basically he goes out of his way to make things even more difficult than they need to be. In the dying minutes of the film we discover he has actually contacted a claimant's union or benefits lawyer when this should have been one of the first things he should have done. He's portrayed as an articulate and social man so it makes little sense that he spends his time being angry with the system instead of fighting it. All the benefits workers, save one, are portrayed as heartless bastards even though they too are working people living on low wages. It's mostly not their fault, it's the fault of the system, yet they constantly get blamed.I can't help noticing in passing that Daniel Blake has extraordinary skills in woodworking and we see him make a top notch bookcase and exquisite hand-chiselled toys. Clearly he could start making bespoke furniture for toffs and sell his toys at craft fairs and make a small fortune. OK, I'm being facetious but it seriously struck me that that was what he should do.As for the ending it's just a massive cop out. This is a well-made and watchable film with outstanding performances from Dave Johns and Hayley Squires but as an indictment of a rotten and degrading system it tries too hard to make Daniel Blake a victim and almost everyone else a pantomime baddie. I suspect this would have been a better film if it had been called I, Katie and followed her story with Daniel Blake as the minor character."
" I am not a number, I am a free man...
",2017-09-05 00:00:00,8,"A damning indictment of a dehumanising culture; a continuous hamster wheel, purpose-built to break the spirit. It's a poor society that transforms those struggling, into statistics to be shoved to one side, rather than seeing them as proud people driven to desperate measures.I do disagree with Mr. Loach about one thing, though - it's not the people working within the benefits system that are the problem... it's the system itself. Don't attack the people who are just doing their job and trying to get by, like everyone else. Train that righteous anger on the real enemy - the government who keeps such draconian machinery in place, as part of an ideological vision, to further their own ends."
" I Daniel Blake Cries Out For Fairness.
",2017-09-02 00:00:00,9,"Ken Loach (Kez '69) is a controversial filmmaker (yes he uses film) who, along with screenwriter Paul Laverty are no strangers to taking on the challenging everyday issues of real life. Their story follows the trials of 59 yr old carpenter Daniel Blake, as he attempts to enlist assistance from an impersonal welfare system. Daniel can build you a house but has no computer skills - this is where we see the foolishness of enforcing 'on-line' services before the generation who grew up without them have passed.Performances are good --kids included which is always a plus-- the inclusion of a now rarely played composition by Ronald Binge is a powerful insight to a passing era and emotionally strong. Documentary photographer Robbie Ryan adds realistic touches as this brave crew navigate complex social problems - that are both poignant and timely. How will an overloaded public system ever be fully capable of serving the multitude of desperate human situations - especially in the face of increasing immigration, that's mostly made up of people from countries that offer their nationals nothing! Something needs to be done and seriously. Well done by all concerned."
" Its message is blunted by blatant emotional manipulation
",2017-08-30 00:00:00,6,"This grim realist drama succeeds in putting some humanity into the austerity/benefits debate, but Ken Loach undoes the impact of his polemical film with simplistic emotional manipulation. Indeed, Loach's agenda interferes and reduces his storytelling to mere melodrama at least twice.Take the scene in which a starving Katie visits a foodbank; she is surrounded by fruit, bread and vegetables, yet she messily eats cold beans out of a tin and bursts out crying in shame. Why would she eat this when she could choose food that's far easier to eat? Because Ken Loach wants us to feel bad, that's why.And then there's the ending, which sees Daniel and Katie meeting with an adviser who's confident that he can win his appeal. However, just as the film's mood starts to finally buoy, Daniel keels over and dies in the bathroom. Predictable, very predictable. It's surprising that a veteran director like Loach would use such hackneyed emotional manipulation."
" Depressing but important
",2017-08-24 00:00:00,7,"'I, Daniel Blake' is the story of an average working class man who, after suffering a heart attack, is unable to work and requires state benefits. When he applies, he encounters a number of obstacles and is frustrated by a system which deems him fit for work, even though the doctor insists he needs to rest. According to the government, if you can lift your arm above your head, nothing else matters and you must be fit for work.This is a very real film and highlights the many flaws of the UK's benefits system. It's frankly ridiculous how somebody who has worked and paid into the system their whole life is refused help when they really need it.'I, Daniel Blake' is a depressing film but it carries an important message. Everything is accurate, the dialogue feels real and the acting is excellent. Well done Ken Loach for highlighting what a joke the UK's welfare system can be."
" Really good and unique drama documentary..
",2017-08-21 00:00:00,8,"Firstly I should declare that I worked in this area of government (Not ""Social Services"" by the way) for 23 years to what may be a unique level of knowledge, including production of an official Tribunal documentary/training video back in 1989, of which I may have the only remaining copy.How I wish I could have contributed to the script here too, even though I have been out of this work for over 20 years now. This film is really good, highly realistic and long, long overdue. Great Job. Nevertheless the one parent family circumstances were not realistic, unless she very naively moved to the north east for a job that fell through. In any case, with children involved, a Social worker should have put in an appearance.When he tried to sign unemployed and said his Dr. Would not certify him fit for work he would likely have been declined there too! By the time he got his Appeal he might well have been fit for work, and would then have struggled to get arrears without intervention. Yes this would be realistic!The loss of the local offices means that all he can do is attend counter receptions. 20 years ago his claim would have been determined behind reception and often by the person who interviewed him. (29 years ago as a Decision Maker myself I would sometimes see people myself. An appeal could of course be accepted back then in writing at any time after the decision).Nevertheless the courage to tackle this subject is unprecedented. The techniques used are extraordinary and the acting is excellent. I even wonder if some scenes were filmed with natural reactions from people who did not have a script, or prior knowledge of the scenes. This is apparently the case with The Food Pantry scene, and I wonder if true when he asks for help with his PC and the reactions in the street at the end. Terrific spontaneity."
" A touching slice of realism
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,6,"Whilst never being the biggest fan of British director Ken Loach and his rather stoic approach to filmmaking, it's nice to see the passionate filmmaker appear from what at the time seemed as though to be a permanent retirement to come back to our screens with this human interest story and 2016 Palme d'Or winning movie I, Daniel Blake.Likely to enrage as many as it puts to sleep, Blake is a slow yet driven story of 60 odd year old hardworking British citizen Daniel Blake and his battle against the state to be financially supported after the government's frustrating assistance system continues to mess him around and with nothing much more exciting than Blake arguing about resumes or struggling to handle computers, Loach's impassioned tale won't be for everyone but you can certainly appreciate the message being told here.Always one to make social commentary a major part of his films, Blake will be instantly recognisable to fans of the directors previous work's as scenes play out in non-cinematic fashion and Dave John's commendable central performance plays itself out in a highly workmanlike fashion as he seemingly bangs his head against walls trying to find the balance between what he needs to do after his life is turned upside down by his recent heart attack, yet finds possible new meaning when he comes across fellow struggler and single mom Katie and her two children with whom Blake strikes up a friendship with.It's within this budding friendship that Blake finds it's real beating heart as we're thrown into the scenario that Blake's struggles to get the answers he needs aren't at all an out of the ordinary accordance and for many Australian citizens that have ever had to deal with our Centrelink regime, you will no doubt get cold shivers as Blake tries to reason with office workers or get a hold of someone via a phone and it's within these elements that Blake finds itself feeling like a true docu-drama and very far from a polished film production.Final Say – A slow, quiet and often ponderous drama with a rather abrupt and questionable finale, I, Daniel Blake will be a new favourite for die-hard Loach fans and an accessible tale for those seeking a piece of bleak and realistic slice of life struggles in the English landscape, filled with solid if unremarkable performances, a grounded script and an important tale at its core, Loach's film may not be riveting stuff but its humanly engaging and unique in its execution.3 graffiti attacks out of 5"
" I'm not ashamed to say I had tears in my eye's watching this film.
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,10,"REVIEW - I DANIEL BLAKEWhen this film first came out I vowed to go and see it but as it was only shown at a limited number of cinemas and only for 1 week I missed it, so tonight I've just caught up with it and..........I can count on one hand my favourite films,Close Encounters of the Third Kind.Alien's.It's a Wonderful Life.V for vendetta.Empire of the sun.and now I can add this film to that list.Unfortunately what happens in this film is true.Systems are there to break you.The part in the food bank I found especially distressing.A must see.I'm not ashamed to say I had tears in my eye's watching this film.How can one of the richest countries in the world expect it's citizens to be so poor they need to rely on food banks?If you haven't seen this film I urge you to do so, it's not easy watching I'll warm you now but watch it you must."
" Too true!
",2017-07-27 00:00:00,8,"What a Kafkaesque nightmare widower Daniel finds himself in as his doctor tells him, post heart attack, that he mustn't work until he recovers and the Govt body in charge of the temporary pension he needs deems him fit to work. His appeal against this ridiculous decision has to be dealt with by the wonderfully titled ""decision maker"". This faceless, bureaucratic figure is reminiscent of Kafka's castle - you can't reach him/her no matter what forms you fill in and how hard you try. For any who think this is unbelievable let me assure you it is all too true. Because of the topic the film could have been bleak but Daniel's eyes keep their glint of life and humour and above all he keeps his own kindness and humanity in stark contrast to many of the staff he deals with. I hope every staff member at Centrelink (in Oz), above all the CEO and Ministerial ""decision maker"" have to sit and watch this. In my own dealings with Centrelink some staff are lovely, helpful and as kind as the ladies in the film's wonderful food bank scene. However there are those who seem to do their best to try and make you feel inferior and who in loud voices let everyone know in the dreaded queue exactly what you are there for. You are no longer a person but a number in the system. I Daniel reveals this so well. The stand out scenes are those where Daniel tries phoning the Centre and deals with the interminable music (that was like a scene in a horror movie, it brought back such feelings of frustration and anxiety)and even though this is over the top, the scene of Daniel's spraying graffiti on the Centre's wall was so satisfying to watch. His struggles to use a computer were funny but also just so true, I've been the person on the other computer helping ""Daniels""cope with this unfamiliar machine. All the actors were brilliant, from the young children to friends, staff, Daniel and Katie. They all deserve awards. Please do go and see this or borrow it, a truly good film."
" Struggle for survival in the era of neoliberalism
",2017-07-24 00:00:00,9,"According to the Nobel Prize laureate Joseph Stiglitz we live in the economically most unequal times with a class of people who are left behind and for who the social safety net is out of reach. Ken Loach latest film 'I, Daniel Blake' intends to memorialize them and their struggle to survive where they still try to keep their dignity.After suffering from a severe heart attack, the former carpenter Daniel Blake is certified as unfit for work by his doctor. Despite this, healthcare ''experts'' draw a different conclusion wherefore he does not get the benefits he need. Getting no helpful support from the public institutions Daniel only finds solidarity in the young single mother Katie who is in a similar, probably even worse situation like him. Very conspicuous is the direct and incredibly harsh story-telling: For both Daniel and Katie is almost no hope. The employees at the job center do not act like humans and do not have a spark of empathy, Katie needs to support her two children who are in very bad mental health and Daniel is imprisoned in the Kafkaesque bureaucracy of the residue of GB's welfare state. It is heartbreaking to see how they fight to keep their dignity, a fight in which Katie almost fails at one point when she decides to prostitute herself – a powerful scene! The real tragedy becomes apparent in the fact that Katie and especially Daniel, whose character is so authentic depicted by standup comedian Dave Johns, are good-hearted, reasonable and kind people. He helps Katie with his manual skills and takes care of her children while Katie wants to give her children an ordinary life. Their noble character traits are their capital. Nevertheless, this does not help them because for the system they are not individuals, but numbers or just more jobless persons. But to see only the artistic drama and tragedy in the film would underestimate its thematic bandwidth. Behind 'I, Daniel Blake' is also a strong and highly relevant political message concerning the so- called neoliberalism. An economic and political ideology which aim is to tear any state activity on the field of economy down. According to its theorists it is not the states' responsibility to help the poor. Daniel Blake as a fictitious character who is based on real people is one of the victims of this ideology which has led to cuts in the welfare state and wider rifts within society (e.g. Brexit). Thus, the people at the job center act so cold-hearted, because they are trained to do so. Thus, it is so difficult for Daniel to enter an objection in this ''survival-of-the-fittest'', where a sense of community has nearly vanished. In addition, it is certainly no coincidence that ''privatization'' is mentioned at one point. With the portrayal of a system which punishes honest people and let them almost lose everything they have, neoliberalism is the main target of the film and Loach assails how dangerous its ''lean state'' idea is. By the characters of Daniel and Katie, Loach shows this in an impressive and realistic manner. There is only one thing I would criticize concerning the storyline: The ending is a bit too predictable and exaggerated. It was obvious that this will happen if it finally looks like Daniel will win back his humanity, but I do not think that this ''twist'' was really necessary. Of course, other viewers may argue that it is a consistent and appropriate ending.To sum it up, on the one hand I highly recommend watching the film because Loach created a very well-done drama full of impressive scenes which should almost made you cry, featuring a cypress-dark main conflict (honest people vs. a destructive system). Actually, this reminded me a bit of the much darker German drama 'Woyzeck' by Georg Büchner, but that's another point. On the other hand, 'I, Daniel Blake' is a fierce and to-the-point ''call for arms'' against those whose political aim is to crush the social safety net and realize their neoliberal agenda. 9 pts."
" I'd advise people to see it
",2017-07-24 00:00:00,9,"I don't THINK their are real spoilers in this but one comment might be construed as such so I added - 'contains spoilers' even though it doesn't except in the most vague way. The comment is only that the people are more helpful than the system. This is pretty much what the film is about so I don't think it is a surprise or a spoiler but I think IMDb are wise to make us 'not spoil' a film for those that haven't seen it yet, especially in a film like this.I won't go politics but the film portrays a silly governmental system - developed over years and years, from one political party to the next as time moved on. This film is about a system, not a government.Some poor people struggle to get work or be paid their due for being out of work. Or benefits to support their kids. Other countries don't have this at all - so we're lucky in the UK. But when people pay in to a system to help themselves and family and those around them and it seems to work against the old or unskilled or supportive of others it's crazy. This the film highlights well.More than that though - it shows how the people in a community help each other more than the 'English/British' community works in the same way. The poorest sometime help the poorest the most. You wouldn't see this local bonding in, perhaps Berkshire or Chelsea (I'm generalising in a way the film doesn't, but only trying to make a point).A socially interesting film, very well acted by almost all (and in the others only 'better than well' - i.e. better than I'd say in most films from all actors - all were great), directed and filmed (location filming and cinematography was spot on for the film - I loved the small but 'just right' location shots and some of the pre-scene moments).I'd suggest a MUST watch for Brits. For others, I think would be very interesting to see what 30%+ of Britain is really like - it's not all Big Ben and James Bond - the same as USA is not all Wall Street or Boston bars, and France is not all Paris or the Dordogne.Most films I love and watch over and over are 8-9. This is an 8.5. But not a film I'll watch again. It's not that type of film. You'll understand once you see it. But you should.VERY, VERY watchable.But low 'rewatchability' - it's no action film. Just a very GOOD film :)"
" Packs a thunderous emotional and social wallop
",2017-07-14 00:00:00,9,"""I, Daniel Blake"" (2016 release; 100 min.) brings the story of the title character. As the movie opens, a recent widower living in Newcastle, is being interviewed to assess whether he is healthy enough to work (Dan suffers from a heart condition). ""When can I get back to work?"" he keeps asking. As it happens he isn't cleared to work, yet he also is ineligible to unemployment benefits. Along the way, Dan gets to know a young single mother with two kids, who are in sheer desperate conditions. At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from veteran British director Ken Loach, now a crisp 81 years young. ""I, Daniel Blake"" continues his long string of 'social commentary' movies. Here he sheds a light on the British welfare system, and let's just say that it's an unfavorable and uncomfortable light. The absurdities become apparent very quickly. This film caused an uproar in the UK, where a debate raged as to how accurate the film portrays the welfare system. I honestly have no idea, but I can tell you that the movie works very well AS A MOVIE, and it packs a thunderous emotional and social wallop. There are certain scenes you feel both outraged and gutted at the same time. Dave Johns is excellent in the title role, but even better is Hayley Squires as the single mother Katie. She will absolutely floor you. ""I, Daniel Blake"" premiered at the 2016 Cannes festival to immediate acclaim (it won the Palm d'Or), and it has accumulated a bunch of trophies, including Best Film at this year's British equivalent of the Oscars. (In sharp contrast, is was COMPLETELY overlooked by the Oscars...) I don't know why it's taken so long for this movie to get a theater release in the US, but it finally opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended poorly, to my surprise and dismay. ""I, Daniel Blake"" is one of the best films I have seen so far this year (and I see a lot of them), and I strongly encourage you to see this out, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray."
" This is a deeply humane and all-two relevant movie from the 80-year-old English film maker Ken Loach
",2017-07-01 00:00:00,10,"A blistering and emotional incident of faceless bureaucracy is made by veteran British film maker Ken Loach in his superb new movie, I, Daniel Blake, which deservedly won the Palme d'Or at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival.The central character, Daniel Blake, suffered a heart attack at work. Until he is fully recovered he has been strongly advised by his surgeon, GP and physio that he should not attempt to seek gainful employment. After being forced to answer a series of irrelevant questions, a health specialist from one of the companies the government has outsourced its welfare education tests to, notifies Daniel that he is fit for work. Thus, like so many other people, he finds himself caught up in a system of complaints and appeals, waiting for something to change.At first Daniel's good humour carries him through. He may initially appear to be a loner, but when he meets single mother Katie and her two children, his warmth and compassion shines through. For a time his own predicament takes a backseat as he fights for her rights – the scene in a local food bank is heartbreaking as we see how much Kate has sacrificed for her children. But Daniel's case seems to be going nowhere and exasperation with the system finally pushes him to express his exasperation publicly.This is a deeply humane and all-two relevant movie from the 80-year- old Loach and probably his best film since Cathy Come Home, aided of course by a gritty, unsentimental script by his regular collaborator Paul Lavery. Made in the manner of a dramatised documentary, it is angry at a system that demeans people, but has enough compassion for some of the people employed by it whose desire to help those in need is hindered by callous administrators.Of course the film wouldn't have the impact it has without two excellent central performances. Dave Johns, previously known as a stand-up comedian, skillfully balances Daniel's Veneer of gruffness with whip-smart humour, while newcomer Hayley Squires is very moving as Kate.This undoubtedly is the best British Film of last year and shows all too vividly that no one should be treated as a statistic."
" Hardship
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,7,"This film shows how anyone could end dependent on benefits and if people are denied them when they really need them it can be disastrous, it also shows an example that prostitution isn't really a choice for people that are in misery. But I think that poor people should get better access to contraception, people that are already miserable should definitely not create more miserable people."
" Time out of Mind...
",2017-06-24 00:00:00,10,"Many other reviewers have already spoken eloquently and in detail, in praise of this deeply moving, superlative film. I'd just like to offer an observation from a somewhat different angle. What struck me about 'I, Daniel Blake' was an aspect of subaltern powerlessness that pundits often overlook, i.e., that the poor and marginalized are almost never in control of their own time. In the USA dentists, doctors, therapists, lawyers, and all sorts of professionals get to maximize and monetize their time to the nth degree. As for govt. agencies like the DMV or employment or benefits offices--they are often (under-)staffed by bureaucrats who are in no hurry to accommodate John Q. Public. Patients/clients/supplicants wait (and wait and wait) in their spot on the usually stalled conveyor belt to get their allotted modicum of perfunctory attention. After all, they're just cogs in the revenue stream and THEIR time is deemed unimportant. Same thing with phone access to govt. agencies, bureaucracies, insurance companies, you name it. These corporate entities have complex and often confusing ""phone trees,"" long wait times on hold (during which horrendous music plays), and customers reps who are often either obtuse, indifferent, mean-spirited, or confused themselves. For the poor seeking any sort of public assistance these nuisances and indignities are multiplied tenfold because--as 'I, Daniel Blake' dramatizes--the System doesn't really want to serve the so-called ""disadvantaged""; it wants poor folk in need to get discouraged and go away (and hopefully die and decrease the surplus population)."
" A Revolutionary Attack on Our First World Problems
",2017-06-08 00:00:00,7,"An unemployed man converses with an employed woman, only their voices fill up the black screen. One end clearly misunderstands the needs of her client, just like the business-minded telephone operators we know all too well. The man being berated is named Daniel Blake, and these types of meetings occur daily for him. Too long now he has sought after regular employment, yet his poor health legally prohibits him from that end goal.We all know the government's tendency to mistreat whomever struggles to attain work, a reality amplified through a megaphone by the veteran British director Ken Loach in his weepy drama, I, Daniel Blake. The UK already widely respects Loach, but for those in the US, his work deserves intense study. Every quiet image he crafts pleases the analytical eye, especially his many gorgeous compositions of Daniel walking hands in pockets through the streets. Throughout the somewhat short runtime, Loach makes you lose track of how many minutes pass by as the events tie into a complete account of a man who laughed at defeat in the face.In the first half, Daniel Blake's search offers some nice chuckles structured amongst agitation with authorities who hold back their listening ears. By the second half, Daniel's desperation handcuffs you to his ankles as he runs in circles. After surviving jingle after jingle of incompetent phone operators, Daniel's desperation leaves him furious at everyone, including a random passerby whose dog takes a dump in front of his home. Then after a chance meeting in the unemployment office, the mood starts to change. He meets a young single mother named Katie whom the specialists bully around worse than him, so Daniel channels his frustration into compassion as he offers help in her embarrassment of a home. Daniel soon lightens the mood by teaching her son and daughter how to stay warm with bubble wrap and flower pots. Now neither one of them have to individually obtain financial stability alone.Though despite the temporary positivity, things still go from worse to unbearable. The character study rings true to how job services work: Daniel learns how to use a computer, and Katie suffers a mental breakdown at a food bank. The absence of financial income gradually destroys each of their complexions; Daniel seems grow older as the film goes on; it causes you to think, ""Wow, I have been there before. I wish I could help somehow.""At least Daniel Blake can offer one gift outside the workforce with his homemade wooden fish mobile, which he uses to inspire the children's self-worth. Yet woodcarving does not fulfill the children's miserable predicament; their tiny home of peeled wood and tile pales against the cold steel of the employment service offices. It turns you desperate as the well-fed authorities stroke their own egos. ​ In fact, Ken Loach presses a little too much hate toward authority by beautifying unlawful rebellion from the poor. A subplot about Daniel's Black neighbor selling counterfeit shoes contributes little to the plot, besides throwing in a last resort to gaining profit that never receives a rightful punishment. These shoes were acquired by a liaison from China, which in turn worsens the reputation of the already disrespected country. The same goes to anyone above the lower class: an excessively negative shadow casts over their poor productivity; a fair analysis finds no balance between both sides of the issue.On the other hand, Loach's piece of well-researched propaganda might very well be the wake-up call the Jobseekers Allowance needs to see our perspective of their industry. Too few jobs exist for nationwide fulfilment; the system must change.Landing a job in our present era is unimaginably hard for anyone, whether the elderly, new parents, or young adults such as myself. The journey may feel endless, we may even want to practice alternate illegal solutions. Therefore, I, Daniel Blake deserves a watch by all who suffer. Although no one should expect a typical Hollywood ending, a satisfactory solution to life's purpose as a citizen will remind you, the reader, of your power, no matter what the government expects you to think."
" Your Call Is Important To Us
",2017-06-06 00:00:00,9,"I came out of this movie in tears. At 65, I could easily imagine what it would be like to be in Daniel's shoes. The acting was absolutely marvellous, the nuances very subtle. As the Western World privatizes, this could be the fate that awaits any of us. One day all the boxes are checked and your life moves along smoothly. Then suddenly one thing happens, and there is a cascade of consequences. I remember the old days when you phoned an organization and there was an actual human being at the end of the line, now you are lucky if there is even an Avatar. The little kids were adorable, thank God children seem to be born with computer skills buried in their DNA. Simple people like Katie come along and make life worthwhile. Coconuts are definitely more dangerous than sharks!"
" Incapacitates carpenter struggle for social support
",2017-06-04 00:00:00,8,"The title emphatically states the hero's affirmation of his identity and rights. He may be the helpless object battered about by the social system but he makes himself the subject of his own story. That's why he spray-paints his cause on the bureau's outside wall — and evokes a chorus of citizen support..The heartless muscle-bound social welfare system is a fair depiction of what happens when legislation turns its back on humanity. It's the Alt Right's dream come true, the objective of the Thatcher, Harper, Bush and especially now Trump governments. One worker from the welfare office comes to Daniel's funeral, But then, she sensed his vulnerability earlier and courted criticism from her ""superior"" when she tried helping him navigate the online form-filling. Her coworkers take pride in enforcing their system's insensitivity, always buttressed by The Law. As a good Leftie, director Ken Loach does not despair at the government's inhumanity. Rather, he punctuates the official cruelty with periodic examples of individuals helping out, people being human.In addition to that clerk, the department store manager personally intervenes to negate the security officer's arrest of the shoplifter. His good deed is promptly balanced by the dubious assistance offered by that security officer, a part-time procurer. In the food bank scene Katie is treated most generously, not just with the abundant provision of supplies but by the staff's kindness when she humiliates herself by ripping open a can of fruit, desperate from hunger. Katie went hungry to feed her helper Daniel.So however bleak the situation Loach finds hope in the brotherhood of man. His neighbour and friend China may be a hustler and a slob but his offer of help is sincere. The hero's name resonates. He's another Daniel in a lion's den, struggling to survive in the jungle of savage red tape. The Blake recalls William Blake, poet of the industrially stained London and the ""mind-forged manacles"" imposed upon but accepted by the broken citizenry. While the younger Katie pieces out a meagre existence Daniel's resources steadily shrink. He loses his support payments, has to sell off his furniture, shrinking his life to a blanketed quiver. His dignity keeps him from the food bank. By the time he wins his day of appeal, and with salvation near, his heart buckles from the strain. True to the naturalistic tenor of the story, the social vision, the casting and performances, and the absence of consoling sentimental music, the film eschews the happy ending obligatory in American film. Blake's death is as purely a release as Lear's and the final condemnation of the system that privileges process over people. Here Loach's heart and head seem to operate in sync. Not so in his joining the BDS-holes who would undermine the only democracy in the Middle East, the sole guarantor of religious, political, gender and civil rights, i.e. Israel.As is common among the ""useful idiots"" on the Left, Loach responds with appropriate compassion to the suffering of the Palestinians. His error is in defining its cause. What he fails to realize is that this horrible suffering is the fault not of Israel but of the Palestinians' own elected tyrannies and their determination to waste generation after generation of their own lives in their hope to eradicate the Jews. After all, the Palestinians could have had their own prosperous, healthy and secure independent state at any time since 1922 — if they had only accepted peaceful coexistence with the Jewish state. They have persistently rejected that peace. So, when Israel withdrew from Gaza and the Palestinians had the chance to prove themselves a responsible state, they instead promoted their genocidal intention anew, firing hundreds of rockets at Israeli civilians and building invasive tunnels to attack. Supporting the Palestines against Israel only advances their abusive enslavement by their own government."
" One mans fight against the system
",2017-05-23 00:00:00,8,"Ken Loach does it again. This is a new social drama where we get very close to the hard realities of life for working people. The film is straight-down, unnoticed and gives a brutal depiction of an individual's encounter with a bad and little friendly welfare system. The main character of the film suffers from bad health after a long life in the workplace, and encounters a hard reality depicted in the film. The movie is therefore good at depicting what it means to fall outside and stand alone. Ken Loach really burns to make an important message, and perhaps breaking down prejudices against people receiving social security benefits or other support schemes. We meet the people behind the numbers in this movie, the people in the statistics. It makes an impression, it is tough but also insightful. I can only recommend the movie and this is certainly one of the better in its genre."
" a critic view to the state
",2017-05-15 00:00:00,6,"this is a movie that will describe this epoch to the latter generations. how state is intervened to the life, the automatic call replies that make you crazy, all the staff like this. the hard lives can exist even in the very developed nations like UK. On the other hand there are some clichés that seems a bit cheap for this movie. I guess Internet, CDs are in everybody's life.,"
" Great performance by Dave Johns
",2017-05-11 00:00:00,8,"I, Daniel Blake is a damn good film that calls for solidarity between the working classes irrespective of race. It calls for decency and kindness towards your fellow human being in this internet age. I strongly recommend it.The film boasts of a great performance by Dave Johns. I loved the wry smile that he wore in the face of all odds. Johns bestows the character of Daniel Blake with an air of sardonic resignation as he faces one setback after the other at the hands of bureaucracy and modern technology. I also liked the way he walked with his hands inside his pocket. His walk exuded pragmatism and grit.Hayley Squires was brilliant as the single mother who is on the verge of poverty. The scene where she stuffs beans into her mouth like a glutton was very shocking.The film is filled with many touching and hilarious moments. Moments that we might all have gone through and made us want to tear our hair out. I am sure everyone (not just the working classes) can identify with the scenes where Daniel Blake has to deal with robotic recorded phone messages, unhelpful customer service executives and long forms that have to be filled in.I would like to end this short review with a note of caution. With the election of Donald Trump, Britain's exit from the Eurozone and the popularity of right-wing leaders like Marine Le Penn and Geert Wilders, the film's portrayal of race relations might be a bit too optimistic."
" Very realistic, will leave you thinking.
",2017-05-06 00:00:00,9,"This is a story of Dan and Katie, each of them caught in financially tough situations. Each struggling to maintain their self respect, which is the very thing that's being asked for to let them survive. The movie was engaging throughout. Story is beautifully told. Clever script to bring out the story from subtle situations. Also very relevant in current political climate where unemployment is leading to proposing of extreme steps by some faction of leaders. Helps understand the difficulties and struggles of the other side, for those of us who are lucky to be doing well."
" We are all Daniel Blake
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,9,"My first review ever in IMDb, and this movie is just too powerful to make me write it. Depressingly amazing, realistic to the bone with only one message, to these years of economic crisis, all the middle/working class people, we all suffer under the brutality of the open market and governments that just don't care about their people. We all try to survive this cruel world. We are all Daniel Blake. A must watch."
" Cracking British Film
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,8,"Phil's Quick Capsule Review: I, Daniel Blake is a tough watch. Whilst it shows there is hope in the actions of others, it's over arching presentation of a society so consumed by technology and so lacking in a human touch, you cant help but leave reflecting how life is so hard for some in life today. It's powerful stuff. That said it's not without heart and laughs but the bleakness hits home from the start. If it has a problem it's that it's story beats are predictable but the film is so well played you forgive it for them.Best Bit: The performances Buy, Stream, Avoid: StreamIf You Liked this Try: The Angels Share, The Wind That Shakes The Barley, KessFor more check out www.philhobden.co.UK"
" If you can accept the politics it isn't bad.
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,4,"The acting is bland and unrealistic. The directing doesn't create characters or do anything worthwhile.This film plays to a believer in its message. it paints a story that lacks much in reality. it gains it's high reviews from people that support the viewpoint and it isn't a reflection of the merits of the film or its cast.I have personal experience of the benefits system, job centres and food banks. of JSA, ESA and PIP. Also the court appeals system. I have never seen a food bank with a queue of more than 10 people. This is unlike the film where the queue is around the corner. The system is far from perfect but it is nowhere like as bad as this film portrays.Unfortunately this film is simply propaganda and consequently its extreme view doesn't actually help improve the system. It is actually counter productive.This film is such a shame when I expected so much. Did this man really do Cathy come Home ?"
" A reminder that the society is made up of all kinds of people and some of them need gentle assistance.
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,7,"There was an Oscar buzz for this. Many film experts thought it would sail through, but that did not happen. Now I saw it and I think it should have made into. If the priests' dirty secrets were recognised to condemn on such a big platform, then this film deserves as well. Because it reveals the cruelty against the economically weaker families and computer illiterate old men.It is only this much short to be called a documentary film. I mean it was very realistic with cinematic dialogues, otherwise a documentary. This is a message film, highlights what's wrong with our system and who are all suffering from it. The actors were great and the 80 years- old director had done a magnificent job. You could watch as many films you want, but if you fail to watch a film like this often, there no meaning getting into film watching business.The story follows a 60 year old widower whose name mentioned in the title. As he is recovering from heart attack and as advise given by his doctor, now he's out of the job and support allowance. Whenever he approaches the officials to look his issue, they always come up with different reasons to send him back disappointing. Especially not being into the computers, he struggles to fill forms on the internet platform.He's very patience and following everything they have told him to do. One day he comes to aid to a single mother with two kids who recently moved to the city from London, when she is too struggling in the employment agency to get a job. So their relationship grows as they lend hands to one another in tough times. Following, how they recover from the issues they are facing is what the film to cover in the remaining parts.❝Listen, you know, you give me a plot of land, I can build you a house. But I've never been anywhere near a computer.❞I liked this the film, but I think it was too realistic for my kind of taste. Because I like emotional parts and in this film those parts were highly effective, but not sentimentally striking way. Maybe you can say, less music with more dramatisation changed the storytelling style. Though the focus given on economically lower class and their way of life, not intentionally, but lack of support in society, all these were well detailed. I have always supported films that point outs flaws in basic establishment in society.Almost all the major struggling juncture one goes through in the employment agency, particularly if the person was old is uncovered. Like the telephone calls responding to the recorded message, online applications, as well as meeting them in person. What we're facing right now in the world is or to know is, not everybody is a computer literate. It'll be in the future, but not now. They are not getting proper help, particularly agency treating them like the illegal immigrants.In addition the film gets more interesting when a single mother was introduced. On the other side, different issues faced by poverty ridden small family, particularly her desperate attempt to fulfill the basic needs of her children is heartbreaking. This is not just the English problem, but everywhere else in the world. It had won several awards, particularly one BAFTA award. A good film for everyone, only if you understand the notion of the film or else will be a boring film.While I was watching it, I thought it was a regular kind drama, so I kept expecting that things would turn this and that way. For almost the entire film, but it's only in the final stage something it came up with to surprise me. So my advice is keep low expectation and be patience. More importantly accept what it reveals than what you want from it. If you fail on that, then its not your film and to know that the only way is to watch it.7½/10"
" Important Film
",2017-04-08 00:00:00,10,"Honestly, I'm too upset and exhausted after watching that to write a substantial review. As someone who's been put through this system and is waiting under the sword of Damocles to go through it again, this was a hard bloody watch. But I knew it was important so I made myself watch it. I was actually surprised how well they captured the process. So much resonated. It's very hard to put into words when you're going through it but there's this ubiquitous enmity from start to finish, regardless of the legitimacy of your claim, regardless of your circumstances. It's nothing less than psychological warfare aimed squarely at the working classes and the disabled who cannot win in this situation. I particularly like how they captured the disgusting Catch 22 aspect of this rigged process. Whereby all legitimate claims are cynically refused by default. Then they automatically switch you to jobseeker's allowance from which point they set the rottweilers on you to bully you into paid or unpaid work by a process of harassment and public humiliation. It's easily the most sinister process I've ever experienced. I was shocked and horrified by it. There have been many stories in the press about people who are patently unfit for work who have been deemed fit for work by these criminals. And they inevitably end up killing themselves. The UK took a sinister run when Thatcher took power. The country has never been the same since. It is no less than warfare on the working classes, the poor, the disabled, and the sick. It's about time we drove these crooked traitors out of their comfortable leather chairs in Westminster and gave them a taste of their own medicine. It's gone too far. Anyway that's more than I wanted to say. I can't fault the film. It crammed a lot in there to illustrate the problem start to finish and I salute Ken Loach for this very important piece of work. Great acting and cinematography. A special nod to the people who played the bad guys. That is hard to pull off. It sent shivers down my spine they did such a good job. Thank you Ken Loach."
" The world would be a better place with more filmmakers like Ken Loach
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,8,"After watching I, Daniel Blake I can't help but feel that films like this; that are so honest of their subject matter, sympathetic to those suffering and simultaneously strongly critical of a great injustice, are remarkably rare. This is in no small part due to the fact that creating such a genuine portrayal is not easy, and that Ken Loach is clearly an artist capable to exceptional levels of empathy. But still the film leaves me feeling that so much of modern cinema is merely introspective in comparison to this great film.Of course making all films of this style would be hugely limiting, but I suppose that this is how you feel after watching a truly excellent film. I, Daniel Blake has had that effect on me.I would also like to concur with other reviewers who have stated that those who serve us in the houses of parliament could well greatly benefit from a screening, and am reminded of Alain Juppe screening La Haine for the members of his cabinet."
" A grim night in for all the family
",2017-03-30 00:00:00,6,"I Daniel Blake is quite possibly the most depressing film I have ever seen. I'm a big fan of Ken Loach and have enjoyed much of his previous work. But this film is so grim it made me want to listen to the Smiths watch Schindlers List to cheer me up! Even at the end of the film just as things might be looking up for our hero he drops dead. The film just moves from one depressing scene to another and just when you think things can't get any worse for Daniel Blake they do. Whilst at the job centre Daniel strikes up a totally implausible relationship with a single mother with two children who has moved to Newcastle from London as that's the nearest housing available for her needs? She off course will do anything so her kids are feed including theft, prostitution and using the local food bank where such is her hunger she has to open a tin of beans there and then and pour into her mouth. I know they say it's grim up north but this made me yearn for a two week break in Syria. I desperately wanted to like this film but I just found it implausible and a miserable experience all round."
" Worth watching, but not the best of it's kind
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,6,"Maybe if I was British I would have enjoyed it more.The idea is not new, but well presented. Directors paid attention to details, and scenes are quite professional.Nevertheless, most of the actors play quite casual. The conversations are rather shallow, and the plot, including the ending is quite expected.Don't get me wrong; this is not a bad movie. But if you want to get what I mean, see Tyrannosaur (2011).Cheers"
" Ken Loach with his best film ever
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,9,"This is one of the best films I've seen so far at the FFO. With all what the world is going through right now, a movie like this is a wake up call to all the fake leaders out there. I enjoyed the acting and the story. This is a dead end for humanity. Hopefully it will reach some decision maker. Not to be missed!"
" Great movie
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""I, Daniel Blake"" (2016) is one of the most simple and powerful movies I've seen in a long time. The story itself here i can't even call it a story, because it shows a true life, down to the ground. It is a story which happened to thousands, and unfortunately will happen again. Script was realistic and plausible as it gets. It never felt pushed or over-written. Acting by two leading actors was simply perfect as well crystal clear directing. There is no music in this movie, no other ""craftsmanship"" of films - it can be watched as a documentary - it is that good and raw experience. Overall, ""I, Daniel Blake"" is not an entertainment cinema. Its a raw, powerful and heartbreaking look at realities a man must face at the end of his life, when there is seemingly no help and no hope. It doesn't end on a happy note nor there is bright light at the end - yet somehow a man finds inner will to help others by giving what money can't buy - kindness and hope. ""I, Daniel Blake"" is a statement to today's society which can be and is unforgiving to a citizen. Great movie."
" Searing indictment of the Tory austerity measures since 2010
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,10,"I, Daniel Blake is not easy viewing, and nor should it be. For fifty years, director Ken Loach has been making films with a finger on the pulse of modern Britain and here, in the 'twilight' of his career, he provides us with arguably his most provocative, touching and downright important film since the days of 'Kathy Come Home' first peeled back the layers of squalid British life to show the humanity of people let down by a system ignorant and uncaring of the predicaments it has itself caused.Daniel Blake is a lifelong carpenter, struck down by a serious heart condition and left to navigate the dense and seemingly obtuse benefits system apparently designed to hinder, not help him. Told he is unfit to work by his GP, Daniel is however failed on the all-works test by a 'health professional' and then pushed from pillar to post by a system that demands a sick man looks for work that isn't there, to satisfy benefit conditions he cannot hope to fulfil. The Orwellian system of online applications, claim forms and appeal hearings leaves the close to retirement Daniel perplexed and frustrated in a world of faceless bureaucracy and a digital welfare system that is as alien to him as a monkey wrench would be to a web designer.Amidst this daily grind to find common sense amongst automated applications and robotic administrators, Daniel meets Katie, a young single mum just arrived from London, and the two strike up a deep friendship based on their shared failure to fit into a world that regards them as clients and customers rather than people. Together they experience the real-life shames of food banks, shop-lifting and prostitution, as Katie skips meals to feed her kids and steals sanitary products when the measly handouts run dry. Ultimately she has little choice but turn to prostitution, trading in the only asset society has left her - her looks - and when Daniel tries to persuade her that selling herself (and her self-respect) is a step too far, their friendship is threatened, leaving Daniel destitute and without even the small amount of hope left in his increasingly perilous life.Loach's casting and direction makes the most of a superlative cast - as is his signature - and the grim and grimy streets of Newcastle are depicted with a typically documentary feel (it's often unsure whether the extras in the film are aware they are being filmed or not, which in a segment showing Daniel's arrest after he graffitis the local Jobcentre Plus chimes particularly true). It would be easy in another filmmaker's hands to be overwhelmed by the despair and helplessness that Daniel and Katie often feel, but Loach never forgets the small pieces of kindness that make a difference in even the most untenable of situations. A sympathetic Jobcentre adviser and an indulgent supermarket manager both remind us that not everyone is of the opinion that benefit claimants have brought their own troubles upon themselves, and these small but precious slices of humanity do much to keep a focus on the heart of the piece - those left behind when an unsympathetic and out of touch government see the most vulnerable as the first target when it comes to tightening the trouser belt.But as with life, I, Daniel Blake doesn't come with a neatly tied happy ending. Just as Daniel's perseverance with playing the system by its own rules seems to have won out, he suffers a fatal heart attack while in the bathroom of the very claims centre who are about to end his journey into purgatory. It's a real sucker-punch moment, delivered with alacrity as Daniel's final moments occur off-screen, leaving the emotional fallout of his death to be enacted by the panicked actions of the staff who discover him and the wailing grief of Katie, who having reconciled with Daniel had accompanied him to his review appeal.Films can make us feel sad, happy, exhilarated and shell-shocked all in the space of a couple of hours, but not often do they leave the viewer seething with anger and shaking their head at a story ripped straight from the tabloid headlines and documentary programmes of our everyday lives. Ken Loach has proved once again that, despite his advancing years, he is as unwilling to go gentle into that good night as he was when he first turned his outraged vision on Britain's underclasses half a century ago. I, Daniel Blake deserves the widest audience possible, from the strata most affected by the events it depicts to the comfortable middle-classes whose understanding stretches only so far as the Daily Mail. Five Star filmmaking on every level, and a priceless document for our uncertain, troubled times."
" British Working Class
",2017-03-23 00:00:00,8,"I went into this film as an American with little knowledge of the benefit system in England. I guess dealing with paper pushers with little empathy is a universal problem. Daniel Blake(David Jones) is a 59 year-old carpenter who has suffered a heart attack, and, is unable to work. He gets trapped in a catch 22 of having to receive government aid either as someone cannot who work any longer or as a man who can work in a less physical capacity. Thus begins the incredible journey of Daniel Blake, the ultimate every man. Daniel visits the benefits office and is told that he must fill out his application on line and he explains that he has no skill with computers. He eventually gets help from a neighbor in getting on line but he still winds up in a merry go round which just worsens his crumbling world. He befriends a young woman with two children who also struggles with the British welfare system. Director Ken Loach uses a documentary style to deliver a sad commentary on bureaucracy. The only drawback for me was,that, as an American, I had some trouble with the regional working class accents. Otherwise, an excellent film."
" Completely heartbreaking.
",2017-03-21 00:00:00,8,"One of the most affecting realist social dramas I have seen, and the best since Two Days, One Night. Ken Loach is a master at this stuff, but the secret to getting on board with such tragedy is twofold - how much you relate to the subject matter, and how contrived are the situations that unfold to prove the point. The awful, heartbreaking reality of the poverty line and the injustices inherent in the failing systems that profess to be helping people is a subject I have some personal experience of and I have to say I was in pieces watching certain scenes of I, Daniel Blake. So woven through with the ring of truth it looks like it must have been easy to make. How skillfully hidden therefore is the immense talent it takes to do that!Relative newcomer Hayley Squires is a revelation. I will never forget how deeply touched I was watching the horrific simplicity of one particular scene. If you have seen it you will know which one. Too bleak and cold for me to rate this higher than 8/10, but for the type of film it is there are few better. An important document of something devastatingly sad and unfair that is actually happening in 2016/17."
" Gripping and moving
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,10,"This is an excellent movie. Brilliantly written and directed, this is a no holds barred look at the British benefits system and how it dehumanises people who need State funded help.The two lead characters have gripping back stories. Daniel and Kate help each other come to terms with how the State sees them as nothing but a number and an unwanted burden.The movie is gritty, heart breaking and funny in parts. It is a social commentary that Ken Loach is so good at, showing what a great filmmaker he is. This is not a feel good movie but it is a rewarding and thought provoking watch."
" One of Loach's best films
",2017-03-14 00:00:00,9,"Anyone who may be under the impression that Britain's great social realist Ken Loach has lost the sense of social injustice that has defined his magnificent track record since his milestone BBC television play Cathy Come Home (1966), may be rest assured that there is a still plenty of fire in the prolific English director's belly. In what feels like an angry reaction to the Tories' austerity measures and the tabloid cries of 'Benefits Britain', I, Daniel Blake feels like a war cry to unite the skilled, working-class grafters who continue to be chewed up by a bureaucratic system that is leaving the elderly and those truly in need behind, forcing them to demean themselves for the assistance and care they truly deserve.In Newcastle, Daniel Blake (played by stand-up comedian Dave Johns) is informed by his GP that he has a heart condition that will keep him out of work for the foreseeable future. Apprehensively, but on his doctor's recommendation, he heads to the Job Centre to sign on. He is eager to get back to work, but is confident that a lifetime of hard manual labour and steady work has surely earned him the right to seek aid in his time of need. He is denied employment and support benefits, despite his GP's note, and is systematically passed from one department to another, each of which require him to fill in a form online (he's so clueless with computers that he runs the mouse up the side of the monitor at one point) and provide evidence that he is actively seeking employment, despite his inability to work. So begins a ludicrous, Kafka-esque battle against a system seemingly eager to make the process as difficult as possible.It's an incredibly depressing subject matter, and a topic which tends to lead to extreme reactions, depending on who you speak to and whose opinion they've recently read and decided they agree with. Yet this is certainly not a depressing film, it's actually incredibly funny. There's a real warmth to the script by Paul Laverty, and a real tenderness to the relationship between Daniel and single mother Katie (Hayley Squires); a Londoner who has been moved up North to the next available residence, itself a damning indictment of the soaring house prices in the capital and the government's eagerness to upscale 'urban' neighbourhoods. Struggling to find a job and faced with the same bureaucratic barriers as Daniel, she starves herself so her children can eat hot food, and is caught shoplifting. Perhaps you've shaken your head at the single mother on the bus struggling to control her screaming children, but Loach shows us what life might really be like for those truly in need.In a truly Loachian touch, there's also much joy to be had in the company of working class. Daniel forms a friendship with his young neighbour China (Kema Sikazwe), a cheeky chap who is selling authentic trainers at a cut-price by shrewdly importing them directly from the warehouse (the scene in which Daniel meets his Chinese contact via Skype is one of the film's most hilarious moments). Despite the serious subject matter and occasional heart- breaking moment, there's a weird sense of optimism to the film's sense of injustice. Like a rallying cry to anyone left behind by the system, a triumphant and incredibly satisfying scene of defiance, from which the film gets its title, occurs towards the end of the film. As one would expect, Loach downplays it, ensuring that his message is properly received with a sobering climax. There's talk of Ken Loach going into retirement, and if this proves to be his final film, he's gone out with a bang, delivering from one of the finest movies of his career."
" Powerful and poignant, a true 'must see'
",2017-03-14 00:00:00,10,"In this Ken Loach (Kes, The Wind that shakes the Barley) directed film, screenplay by Paul Laverty (Even the Rain, The Angels' Share), Dave Johns (Dog Town, Mud) stars as Daniel Blake and Hayley Squires (A Royal Night Out, Complicit) as Katie, the single mother.A 59 year-old widower who is recovering from a heart attack, Daniel has been advised by his doctor and other health professionals that he is not well enough to return to work but when he is assessed as fit for work meaning he cannot receive benefits, he enters the surreal world of looking for a job he knows he is not well enough to take.When he sees a single Mum, new to the area and understandably late for her appointment, he tries to help, but Sheila (Sharon Percy: School for Seduction, The Student Prince) is one of the workers who revels in the red tape of their job rather than helping and she insists that security and the job centre security manager (Stephen Clegg in his first role) make them both leave, efficiently doing their job as gatekeepers for the 'decision maker.' As Daniel does odd jobs in her new flat, he gets to know Katie and her two kids, Daisy (Briana Shann in her first role) and Dillon (Dylan Phillip McKeirnan, also in his first role) and they form a strong bond as they try to survive the system that seems determined to ruin their lives.Johns and Squires are superb as these finely drawn characters that never for a moment don't feel real. Shann feels a little too well spoken for the role, but her acting is spot on, but some of the other actors are not as good yet it never detracts from the film.This is a powerful film, not shying away from the moral truth of this sad reflection of today's society. Neither Daniel or Katie are trying to 'play the system' and for this they are punished and pushed to their limits. Not a man to take charity, and one who is more used to helping others whether it be caring for his ill wife or his friendship and moral support to a young woman who is essentially a stranger, the film shows how Daniel's former work colleagues and neighbours offer help when he is in crisis, but as a proud man, he does not want to put anyone else in hardship in ease his suffering.A gritty reflection of a struggle many face, even the colour palette mirrors the slow descent of both of them as the system breaks their spirit. Dry humour intersperses the gloom, when we see Daniel attempting to use the internet to fill in an on-line form or attending a mandatory CV writing workshop, but the grim spectre of helplessness pervades everything. The food bank scene, when circumstances break Daniel and Katie's friendship and when Daisy tries to re-establish contact are particularly heart-wrenching and you can clearly see them deteriorate both mentally and physically.You could have heard a pin drop throughout most of the movie and at the end, I genuinely don't think there was a dry eye in the house. I think every MP and worker within the system should be made to watch this film. No-one should have to go through something so heartless and inhumane. It is about time compassion was brought back.An authentic portrayal of an all too real situation that any ordinary person could find themselves in."
" 10/10 If you're failed to be moved by this you have no heart
",2017-03-14 00:00:00,10,"Saw this at a silver screen showing at the Odeon . So glad they give films a second run and only £3 . The cinema was packed and by the audience reaction everyone was moved by this kitchen sink piece of realism by Ken Loach. I thought this would be a 9.5/10 but the ending secured it as a flawless piece of drama . If Xxx vin diesel or Logan big bucks blockbuster is your thing this may not be for you but this in my view is cinema at its best . One man's struggle against the system becomes a metaphor for Britain's broken benefit merry go round . This was not benefit street fly on the floor documentary where you felt more angry watching , this was ironically more real - you really felt for the characters and those who don't even believe in the ridiculous system they're having to operate . It exposes all the flaws in IDS's failed attempt at shaking up the benefit system under the previous U.K. Coalition government. You'll find yourself cheering , laughing , silently shouting at the screen and crying - it's a film that touches all the emotions. Great acting by Daniel and all of the cast . How did we get to the point where the poorest in our society have the indignity of having to queue for food banks steal sanitary towels ( slight spoiler ) is this England ? In the words of Daniel - I am a man not a dog . See it , it will move you"
" I, Daniel Blake - Alert to our society lacking humanity ...
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,10,"My opinion---""I, Daniel Blake"" is an excellent achievement by Kent Loach among others: (The wind rises 2006, Road Irish 2011, and The part of the angels 2013), is to say that it makes very good films and here c Is even more powerful because dealing on a highly social subject and he will demonstrate and denounce by a subject without any concession to make a plea on the social misery among which a large part of the most fragile population of society is plunged and crushed By an administration which strives to intensify by its obstinacy to follow the strict rules of a system which leaves no room for sensitivity whatsoever, the prerogative of many administrations and their rules devoid of humanity, Served by a blind staff, having only the choice to put into practice those incomprehensible rules of our unfortunate epoch when people are blind to all the evils of others, they do not care about everything. Too much administrative staff lack a total lack of humanity. We will be able to discover, in this film, overwhelming scenes of truth, characters who end up falling into absolute distress and who, despite everything, try to get away with everything, I can say that seeing these scenes of administrative distress and obstinacy, Was in an incredible rage, because YES it exists and YES nobody moves in these administrations managed by certain hierarchies pitiless to the human misfortunes, it is only to see their wages to realize it, but , Alas, they do not give a damn because they Will always be safe from these unfortunates. So much for me, why there is no evolution in these cases, except in the misery it becomes more and more important. To return to the film, this one is of admirable modesty. A film to be discovered, and I can even say that at one time I went through this path of the fighter, finding only blind, emotionally blind people in front of me, it was crazy, but it was a good situation Real and dramatic at the time, from where my best understanding of this very beautiful film received there: ""Palme d'Or at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival"" and many other nominations in other festivals. In conclusion, it is a film punch, which I hope will perhaps awaken a little public opinion, but there I do not believe too much because people only care for them and not Of the misfortune of others, by voting already for the same individuals who govern us all, the time of their mandates. To evolve in a positive way, we must also evolve towards a better understanding of what surrounds us. The two main performers are: ""Dave Johns in the role of Daniel Blake and Hayley Squires in the role of Katie were great with great accuracy in their respective interpretations, which again gave more value to the film.  A film really to discover, I note 10/10 because it deserves a hundred times."
" The Film is not over yet!
",2017-03-10 00:00:00,10,"The Film is not over yet! Ken Loach, at the age of 80, in his recent film ""I Daniel Blake"", remind us again how the film industry with showing violence, sex, rich and powerful hero's, nonsense suspensions and Fake Stories lost the power of real cinema to reflect our painful world. Maybe If you ask the filmmakers all around the world about their goals, 90% of them answer you, that they at least want to entertain you with such bullshit elements. They know exactly something is wrong but at the end, they say that, whether one likes it or not, that's the way it is. If you want to make a film you should respect your audiences and their banal tastes. On the other hand, the audience is getting bored with the tons of movies with similar structures and overdone stories. That is why Godard said that ""The film is over."" I believe nowadays it's not enough to avoid such mainstream elements, perhaps we should recreate a new film system with new deals. However, which as I have said the Filmmakers such ken Loach could be shown the way to survive."
" We are all human beings. Let's start showing it.
",2017-03-07 00:00:00,9,"A heart-breaking, and painful to watch film, that will most likely be turned off by most people looking to escape the reality of the world we live in.A world where systems and box-ticking prevail. Where conversations are replaced and reduced. Where people come second, and the status quo first. This is a movie that shows what life is like for large majorities of proud, earnest people for whom society and it's safety nets have failed them.Where is our concern for others and our compassion for them? These most human of traits flicker ever so gently throughout the movie - but are constantly blown-out by the tow-the-line minions that we've become.I challenge you to watch this movie. And to then find a way to confront the reality of what is life for the less fortunate people in your own community, and to help. In whatever way you can.We are all human beings. Let's start showing it."
" A Poor Representation.
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,7,"As a long term claimant I find that the character Daniel Blake somewhat lets the side down with his impatience and attitude. Hello there! We are not all opposing the system and nor do we lack gratitude.DWP staff are largely rather accommodating so long as you don't backchat. The one thing I find concerning here is that a carpenter of Blake's age had no savings put aside. It is a common trait these days, even among pensioners who have worked all of their lives yet invested nothing into their futures.We simply can't expect to be fed via food banks in 2017. Daniel Blake really let the side down - not for his compassion but for his self- serving attitude which at times failed us all."
" A brutal movie. A real movie. And a global movie.
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,10,"This is every man's movie, and yet the faint of heart should stay away from it. Here, we follow very real characters, delivered by outstanding actors, within an raw and engaging plot, all too real to us. The film really draws you in. And if you have any familiarity with its topic, feelings will be had and shown profusely, whether you want it or not. It's not just ""a heart-wrenching look at the British benefits system"", as said by one reviewer, but a very real - and cruel - portrait of almost every country's welfare state. As an attorney, I was shocked by the accuracy in the description of many situations regarding the experience citizens have when in contact with Social Services in general. What hurts the most is the ending was, of course, fashioned to make a powerful statement. Yet there are many Daniels in the streets walking and falling like flies, because of this endless and insane system that took place and seems designed to wither out its dependents. People are dying because they won't treat them as such, though they contributed all their lives. Daniel's demise should give room for a change in the way things are done. But then we look at the reality of it. Thousands of Daniels are dead. And no one moved an inch anywhere. The political statement here made is not really political; it's a plain fact. Taxpayers should not be treated as rotten food, and the current system deals with them. The movie is effective on delivering that message. The hard part is getting the system to actually acknowledge its flaws, when it's been doing so well in failing citizens for so long."
" An alarming distress call from the capitalist society
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,7,"This story takes place in the UK, but it might as well have taken a place in the States, in France or in Germany. It might have easily happened in Russia or in China (well, maybe not in China, since they don't even pretend to give a damn about their people). So, basically, this film is about all of us.It's an unadorned case of neglect a state gives to a citizen nowadays. Regardless of the fictitious petty details, I, Daniel Blake is a story both quite believable and utterly realistic. A story of a person who just wants to be treated like a human being, but is instead viewed as a liability, a sequence of digits in the computer and a burden to a bunch of tired people doing the so-called social service.And it's also a story of how people help and support each other. Not for money or any other gain, but just because they believe it's the right thing to do. And how much of a difference it might be.Actually, apart from its message, I, Daniel Blake is hardly there, with each episode simply going one after another with no much of a transition. And that's both a flaw and a merit of this film, because, while not being a stellar piece of cinematographic art, it actually feels like a documentary, like a story of real people, not just some made-up characters. And that also means there will be no sweet remedy or some deus ex machina tricks here, just bare realism, which is always a bitter thing for the regular people.Watching this won't make you happier, just like it won't make you believe in any more fairy tales about the great new world we're living in. The problem of this film, however, is that besides telling us that we're neck-deep in sh!t - something most of us know already - it doesn't have much new info. Daniel Blake demands his rights as a citizen and a human being not to be ignored and forgotten, but he definitely doesn't offer any know-how for accomplishing that noble task. And the way even that demand was made is neither gonna leave you happily ignorant nor it's gonna charge you with fury and push you out on the street to protest. It's simply sad, like a poor old lonely man's life - and that kind of sadness is merely depressing and demotivating. Yes Dan, the world sucks, but it's not like you're telling us something new..."
" Brilliant and literally heart-breaking rendition of Kafka's ""Trial"".
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,10,"""I'm a man, not a dog!"" declares a 59-year-old, recently unemployed, carpenter from Newcastle. But his story is precisely that: a state-sponsored gradual metamorphosis of ""a man"" into ""a dog"".In this brutal descent of Daniel Blake into the labyrinthine inferno of modern bureaucracy Ken Loach has shown himself to be a filmmaker of Brechtian caliber. This film is a testament that modern, progressive, and (ostensibly) humanistic capitalism can be perfectly devoid of villains yet be utterly dehumanizing to those it purports to serve.Yes! Strange, isn't it? In a story where angels have their wings trimmed and their throats slashed with efficiency and precision worthy of Josef Mengele there is no executioners; no evildoers. There are, however, those who do their job and those who, occasionally, need to be instructed on how to do better. And that's the beauty of it. Loach knows that all those people serving this system are (in their own minds) perfectly justified in sleeping well at night. After all, even if all of them create evil ends, none of them individually seem to do anything evil. Loach's project, therefore, is to use Daniel Blake as mirror to our moral complacency and its deadly consequences.But above all, his ""J'accuse"" is directed at the system in which doing the right thing becomes irrelevant (even impossible), and in which partisan politics and bottom line define who gets to be human, and who, like Joseph K's last utterance, dies ""like a dog!""."
" An accurate depiction of British benefit system.
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,9,"An accurate depiction of the benefit system is portrayed in this heartbreaking film. For anyone that has been in Daniels predicament, being out of work after a long length of employment, will feel empathy with his position. If you have not had to endure the ridiculousness that is the Welfare system in Britain, prepare to see a typical string of scenarios that makes up the bulk of the film, will wind you up like a tightly coiled spring and send you to the same place, mentally, as Daniel. I predicted the ending and because of his medical condition this wasn't too much of a surprise. This is the only film in a long time that has made me cry. Not at the predictable ending but at the memories that resonated with me about our benefits system and how it degrades you and takes away any dignity or pride that you may have left after being made unemployed."
" Was this supposed to make me feel sorry for dossers?
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,1,"Watched the first 10 minutes, heard the politically correct Mum moan how she 'had a tricky' teenage life and decided I'd seen enough already. The message from the Director is clear, he is saying it is normal for a dosser like the 'PC' Mum from London to expect a TAX PAYER to pay for her mistakes!So the message is, feel free to take the p***, drink, use drugs, have kids with whoever you like and some mug worker will pay for it?! In the meantime, you will get a free house & benefits.I was a centre left before, but this film has made me a militant right!The film is horrendous for every normal person that is born in the UK and wants to work for any reward. This is exactly the type of drivel that has turned the tide of the future by putting the Tories and Trumps of this world in power. And if they (right wingers) want this type of thing done away with? They get my vote now............."
" The most shocking and true to life film I have seen this year.
",2017-02-13 00:00:00,10,"My husband had Cancer 2 years ago, since then like Daniel Blake we have had to suffer the constant threat of losing our sanity to the dreaded Decision Makers. The long wait on the phone, the really annoying 'Music' while you wait and the shocking reality behind the Department of work and pensions where the 'Computer says no!' syndrome. It is my opinion and most likely the opinion of the thousands of benefit claimants out there, that this film is not simply a film Drama, but a true to life reenactment. The film pushed so many buttons and hit so many truths it was unbelievable. There cannot be a I, Daniel Blake 2, just like in real life. We only get one chance. Please DWP don't keep screwing up our lives we only have one."
" Short Review...Thank you Ken Loach
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,9,"I finally joined IMDb because of this movie, I thought it was so great and moving that I wanted to review it and praise it publicly. f this movie doesn't move you or make you angry then you are not alive. The current swing towards ever more ruthless treatment of the unemployed, sick and disadvantaged in Australia is happening now, Australia is still tied to the apron strings of Tory England and what happens there we seem to follow not long after...we must not accept it here!! The main character in the movie are inspiring and strong, very well played by Dave Johns and Hayley Squires....thank god people like Ken Loach exist and are able to do what they do."
" Disappointing Prequel To Blakes 7
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,2,"I take it everyone remembers BLAKES 7 ? This was a late 1970s BBC show where a heroic rebel called Roj Blake gets framed by the fascist Terran Federation for child molesting so Blake wages a guerrilla war with his band of anti-heroic freedom fighters against the establishment . I wonder if Ken Loach ever watched the show because as a prequel it's very similar as well as being totally different and I take it Loach is warning us about the future ? Daniel Blake suffers a heart attack and after being assessed by the state as being fit for work is moved from one benefit (ESA) to another(JSA) and this involves having to attend a job centre , the precursor to a federation torture chamber which is populated by heartless , cruel fascists and it's only Blake who has the moral fibre to stick up against the system . Before long he's befriended a young single mother with a young child . Hmmm old bloke befriends single mother ? Nothing suspicious going on there I have noticed some people consider this as a film produced as social realist cinema but it is no more realist than a Terry Nation fantasy show set in the far flung future . I DANIEL BLAKE is socialist myth where the proletariat are victims and it's only the ruling class who can save them . Check the scene where Blake gets a phone call from a prospective employer offering Blake a job where Blake turns it down because ""My doctor says I'm not well enough to return to work"" . So a member of the underclass is obeying what a bourgeois intellectual tells him . In other words he views himself as unable to make decisions for himself ? How's that song go ? ""We need no condescending savoirs to rule us from the judgement hall. We workers ask not for their favours let us consult for all"" Don't waste your time or money watching this . It's very easy to find out about poverty in Britain because there's so many poverty stricken people about . None of them are film directors who get lauded because of their phony politics . If you've got to watch a fictional film to understand poverty then it's because you've been deliberately ignoring the reality of life in Britain in the early 21st Century . Shame on you"
" A hard hitting portrayal of life in the system
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,9,"** This review may contain spoilers ** This movie is so accurate on so many levels, that anyone who has ever dealt with such petty welfare bureaucrats, will immediately relate to this film. More concerned with following rules (the essence of bureaucracy) than helping people with their problems in a time of need, they drive people to despair and to the point of taking often desperate measures to have their voices heard or just to survive, just like Daniel Blake in this film. This film almost has a cinema vérité feel to it, in the grittiness of it's portrayal of the environment and the people in it. Despite the grimness of it's subject matter, it has moments of humor and heart warming moments of kindness, of one neighbor helping the other and such kindness reciprocated. On the other hand it's a damning indictment of the welfare system in the UK (and elsewhere too, I doubt it is much different) and the impersonal way it treats the often most desperate of society's citizens. The food bank scene was hard to watch, as others have stated. You're left shaking your head and thinking ""People shouldn't be reduced to this"". The ending isn't the ending you wanted for Daniel Blake (I won't say what it is), because you're rooting for the guy and you want him to finally get the break he deserves, but it does help hit the point home. Ken Loach has produced a wonderful film. It will make you laugh and cry, but it will also make you mad, mad that people are treated the way they are. I wish every politician (and welfare case worker) was forced to watch this film and then maybe they would grow some humanity in their souls. I've watched a lot of movies in the past year, but few have moved me as much as this. Watch it!"
" Demanding Dignity
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,7,"Right from the opening credits in which the title character argues with a ""health care professional"" against a pitch black screen, Ken Loach fuses wry humour with bleak drama to present a potent look at bureaucracy gone mad here. The plot focuses on a carpenter who finds himself unable to obtain welfare when his doctor declares him unfit for work since the state's medical examiners disagree. This plunges the ageing man into a near Kafkaesque nightmare, told that the only way he can retain welfare is through jobseekers allowance, which means applying for jobs that he knows he cannot take just to show that he deserves welfare. Modern technology also proves a challenge as forms are only available online and he has never used a computer. The humour regarding Blake's unfamiliarity with computers is arguably a misstep as it mocks him as opposed to bureaucratic red tape, however, it also offers a timely reminder that not everyone is computer literate - and that the most disadvantaged in most desperate need may not even be able to afford a computer. A subplot in which Blake helps a single mother in similarly dire straits adds further dimension to his character. At first, this almost seems a character flaw, helping others yet unwilling to accept help himself (his neighbour offers on multiple occasions) but the emotionally charged final scene suggests that there is something greatly amiss with a system that forces one into such a corner. With the humour gradually declining as the film spirals towards its climax, 'I, Daniel Blake' concludes feeling like a very angry film without answers. This is may not be the inspirational movie one might expect given the premise, but there is something certainly refreshing about how down-to-earth the film feels due to this."
" The state
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,6,"A very true and realistic understanding of how the ""system"" works. Probably nothing will change in real life on how the benefits system is run or handled,this powerful take on honest people falling on hardtimes needed to be made. The people portrayed in this movie are not scum but are forced down a road of worry and confidence battering misery. A system failure for the ones who really do need the help of the services they pay into. The truth is this happens,and as sad as it is it usually gets overlooked. People need a system where they are looked at as an individual/family, not as a number and listened too for their individual circumstance. When desperation creeps in and humility and self pride,its a downward spiral of despair. Just not to be listened too and following bad protocol has been enough for people to be homeless or taking their own lives. A really good watch,highlighting true grit,spirit,help and desperation. Ken loach makes these films with messages too all,kindness isn't mandatory,some people help others and some don't. The government trys its best not to help anybody if they can wriggle out of it. AWFUL."
" Good, if a little unbalanced.
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,7,"I, Daniel Blake is a gritty drama which lets the viewer experience the frustrations of dealing with the British welfare system. Having had personal experience of the system in the past, the portrayal is very accurate and dealing with it can be a stressful, hair pulling out experience. I did, however, feel that there wasn't a great deal of balance to this film. Some people do take advantage of the system and not every working class person is a salt of the earth, do anything for you type. The ending also grated on me a bit - *****MAJOR SPOILER****** - for me, it would have been better if he had just won his appeal (as happens in the majority of cases) and the speech at the funeral just didn't feel realistic. Sometimes it just felt a bit too contrived, for example the food bank scene. You'd maybe tuck into a bit of fruit or a biscuit, not pour baked beans into your hand. There were other minor niggles like Katie's daughter being a bit posh or Daniel running the mouse up and down the computer screen. We already got that he wasn't internet savvy so making him out to be a complete idiot spoiled otherwise good scenes. I can't help feel that if they hadn't tried to over egg the pudding on a number of occasions, this would have been a much more powerful commentary on the welfare system. To me, it felt like when someone has a really valid point but spoils it by over dramatising. On the plus side, as I said, the actual portrayal of the system was accurate (I also grew to hate that music on the phone) and it was easy to be sympathetic to the character of Daniel. All in all, worth a watch."
" This Is Why We Need Quality Independent Films.
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,10,"If you can get thru not wanting to put your fist thru the faces of most of the characters that Daniel comes up against, then good for you.You may, however, still find yourself pausing the film from time-to-time to give yourself a breather from the dead-shits he's confronted with.This, like all good indie films, is little. But, as it should be, it's big for those involved.This is a hard-luck story of decent, hard-working people butting heads with the non-caring system.Both Daniel and Katie (the single-mother he somewhat adopts; at least in a protective sense) face the frustrations and degradation of a typical bureaucratic system that sees people as numbers and nothing else.From start to finish, 'I, Daniel Blake' is riddled with conflict. And not the typical contrived conflict often found in indie films. This stuff is real and believable. The story is simple, and all this film does is move that story forward, while revealing more and more of the central characters.Films like 'Certain Women' and 'American Honey' cannot for the life of their directors hold a candle to this film. But they should take note of this differing fact: Here, there's a story worth telling; that's told as if the story matters.My Recommendation: See it, and tell everyone you know to do the same."
" Bleak essentially accurate snapshot of the UK benefits system
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,8,"I've been wanting to see this film ever since I first heard about it and finally I managed to watch it last night. I've read most of the reviews already posted here and was interested in the varying interpretations and reactions although I personally felt quite a few reviewers were, perhaps, seeing elements that weren't actually there.I'm not going to summarise the story, partly as that isn't the purpose of a review and also because it's been summarised ad nauseum in other posts here.I never got the impression Loach was saying all benefit claimants are good people nor that he was implying the 'working class' were all penalised. I took the film to be a 'snapshot' of two people caught up in the benefits system for different reasons.As someone who later in life has had to go through the benefits process to try to claim ESA so many of the specific instances in this film resonated. I kept nodding as Blake tried to 'go through the hoops' as he tried to get help as I had been through the same type of scenario I think my favourite line, which was almost a 'throwaway one' was whilst Blake was on the phone to the DWP help line, waiting to move up the queue and once he gets through and gets nowhere he says ""at least change the bloody music"". Having spent a long time listening to The Four Seasons extract on a loop whilst waiting for someone to answer the DWP phones I knew exactly how he felt.Perhaps what wasn't made clear enough was that the 'Healthcare Professionals' who conduct assessments are employed by private companies contracted by the government and then report their findings to the DWP for a decision to be made. There has been much in the press about the problems with these assessments and they do appear slanted to ensure as many claimants as possible initially get rejected. It is, perhaps, telling that around 60% of people who do appeal have their claims allowed but there are also a large number who never get that far as they get 'worn down' by the bureaucracy.I partially disagree with those reviewers who said the Job Centre officials were portrayed as unfeeling monsters as they are very tightly constrained over what they are actually allowed to do and the current rules they are bound by leave little room for manoeuvre. I would also take issue with the reviewer who seemed to think Blake would have been able to use a computer, many older people are still internet ignorant either from fear of trying it or having no interest in doing so.So viewed as a 'snapshot' I found this film riveting, it didn't drag, made many salient points and hopefully will make audiences think.It isn't easy viewing and won't leave you with a warm and fuzzy feeling when it ends - but I do think it is well worth a look."
" The Shame is Collective
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,9,"If you want a genuine insight into the demonisation of the unemployed, disabled and sick in Britain today, this is as close as it gets. I have accompanied friends to the job centre and assessments and if anything, the bureaucratic blocking, sanctioning and obstructive behaviour of state employed minions, many who have to claim their own tax credits and benefits to sustain their employment is actually underplayed. Deliberate government targets to sanction claimants for the slightest of reasons, keeps the churn of uncertainty and living in misery at peak level. NOBODY chooses this life and the vast majority have 'paid in' all their lives but the genius of the government and top 1% is that those with slightly more than nothing are actively encouraged to deride and abuse those less fortunate. Daily programming of 'benefit cheats', 'state scroungers', 'unemployed with 6 kids' in true 1984 state propaganda agenda they keep the vitriol piling up on those suffering. The increase in food banks from 30 to 450 in 7 years clearly shows a failing state and as we speak the NHS is also being driven into collapse. The U.K. is finished, lowest productivity in Europe driven by despair is all obvious and Loach simply holds the door open for it to be seen. Other comment on the social messaging and say they feel uncomfortable with the political messaging, to those people I say that if the cap fits, wear it. Don't blame the film maker he is simply holding up the mirror for you to look in. This should be mandatory viewing in every school, office and government department. A tough watch, but essential."
" brilliant
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,10,"this is my first review of a film so much so that i felt compelled to join IMDb to leave this review. i will keep it plain and simple for my first.i have just watched this film and shed tears which is not good for a 44yr old man who rarely admits to this!This film is just stunningly simple yet stunningly amazing in every aspect from the acting to the directing to the story, absolutely beautiful. the story is so true and current to what is happening right now to this over populated overstretched island that the politicians need to sit up right now and watch this film."
" Wow
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,10,"Wow, does this film pack a punch.Realistic, gritty, and compulsive viewing. You know this is an outstanding piece of work when you come out of the cinema thinking about what you have just seen, questioning yourself, and actually feel like doing good and being a good person.I took heart that there are a lot of good people in this country, helping and advising, trying to create a civilised and helpful community and society, and it seems that the government, past and present seem hell bent on destroying it. That's the message I got from the film.Anyways, I urge everyone to watch this film, because although it is a serious and sombre film, it actually makes you want to be a good person, and help people more vulnerable and less well off than yourself. That's the genius of the film. And the performances of all the actors are so real and brilliant what with the legend Ken Loach at the helm it's a masterpiece.10 out of 10"
