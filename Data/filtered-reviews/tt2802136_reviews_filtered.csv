" A fun film with a lot of twists and turns
",2020-10-25 00:00:00,8,"Great dark comedy/horror film and perfect for the Halloween season. How far will you go to protect someone you love? This film answers that question in a twisted and dark yet funny way. Not so dark as to disturb you, just a fun comedy horror with great twists and turns and a substantial amount of gore. The humor makes up for the darker moments"
" Anyone else think that this is what Katherine Heigl is like in real life?
",2020-10-07 00:00:00,1,"This movie is really bad. But good bad ... it is just too funny for being even considered as ""good"" - I know women who are like Miss Heigl's character and they are that intense: in fact, I am going to mention this movie at book club as they will know of who I am speaking of."
" Not bad, interesting characters, Good actors
",2020-09-16 00:00:00,6,"I'm surprised by the low rating, I suppose the characters don't meld well with all people?I find the situations to be uncommon in most dramas or comedies. My only problem, which is what I think ruins it a bit, is how unrealistic or dumb Mona's decisions are. I feel like they could have made her a lot more intelligent overall. The movie kind devolves from the first stupid decisions. So that's why I gave it a 6.If you like rom coms or dark comedies then you would probably like it."
" I mistakenly put this off.
",2020-09-09 00:00:00,9,"Home Sweet Hell was always there, on Netflix. But I always put it off. It just looked kind of mediocre. But one day I couldn't find a ""better"" movie, so I gave it a try. It is excellent.Katherine Heigl does a great job, as does everyone else. The story, while dark, is very entertaining. You aren't going to see it coming. Plus it has Jim Belushi.One star off for not enough Jim Belushi. But it is a movie I avoided and have now watched twice. That says it all."
" ""Mommy Kills""
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,7,"Really good watch, would watch again and can recommend.Sometimes, it's important to watch movies with actors of which you're less of a fan. It lowers your expectations and reminds you of their true, objective acting talent.This is a very interesting watch on the real life symptoms and side effects of sociopathy and/or repressed psychopathy. It's the time of psych thriller that is scary because it could be happening to you in your own home. It doesn't mean you're stupid / not perceptive or they're super smart / devious. It just means that they're (at least) slightly more calculated than you.There is a slew of metaphors in here from equals in a relationship to the upper class lording over their lessers, but there is a pivotal moment where they could have expressly made it about men vs women, and it (very obviously) did not turn down that road.Really, if you like pysch thrillers, put this in your queue, I think you'll enjoy it."
" Decent effort
",2020-07-29 00:00:00,6,"This is a dark and subtle comedy with a surprisingly bloody flair. Heigl is good in this role and makes the movie, the men are whinny pantywaists. It's a good waste of time."
" Katherine Heigl mocks people with crohn's disease in this movie.
",2020-07-23 00:00:00,1,"Katherine Heigl's character says ""I'm glad you have Crohn's. I hope you sh** yourself for death!"" in this movie which is mean spirited and very inappropriate. Crohn's disease is an incurable, serious autoimmune disorder. I would recommend to not watch this tasteless movie or any other movies starring Katherine Heigl after this remark. No class."
" Wow but not in a good way
",2020-07-23 00:00:00,1,"Wow- just wow. Let's just this is a horrible, messed up way too violent movie with no like-able characters and outrageous plot. The wife is deranged, the husband is a cheating loser, and his mistress is way too revealing. I feel sorry for the kids and that's about it. A senseless movie with senseless violence that leave little to imagination. Not worth time..."
" Completely overlooked dark comedy
",2020-07-11 00:00:00,8,"This is a dark, brilliantly acted suburban Fairy Tale of the Grimm Brother's variety. Heigle's performance is perhaps her best of her career and Wilson as the doting, yet flawed husband is equally up to the task. The story is well written and not predictable. Instead it takes you on a journey through the minds of both protagonist and antagonist as they flip flop roles. There is no one to cheer for in this movie and yet you do. That is why it triumphs as a darkly cynical comedy."
" A Good Laugh
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,10,I don't know how I didn't hear about this movie sooner but I truely enjoied it!
" SHOCKINGLY FUNNY AND SURPRISING! Not for children
",2020-06-08 00:00:00,8,"I thought this was just going to be a fluffy rom-com. I was completely wrong. Katherine Heigl shines as the scorned wife to Patrick Wilson's wimpy, spineless cheating husband, Jim Belushi stays in his usual lane as a crude, loudmouth coworker at the couple's furniture store. Jordana Brewster is the sexy temptress and the new girl at the store. I can't say more or it would be spoiled.Great dark comedy though!!!"
" Quite entertaining
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,9,The movie kept me entertained throughout. I felt sorry for Don being mistreated by his wife. Though at the end I wish Don hadn't died. That gave it 9 instead of 10 stars.
" Funny and I'm sure to some, a relatable movie.
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,8,"This movie was surprisingly good! And I say that because within the first 20-25 mins of the movie.. it may appear like it's just some goofy, ""simple husband and wife"" story. And it is.... but it's actually good.There's not some surprising plot twist or anything super crazy you'll take away from the movie. But it's a great, STORY.Patrick Wilson played his part sooo well!! I don't want to give any spoilers away, but let's just say.. when I titled this review ""I'm sure to some, it's relatable"", it's because of ""Don Champagne"", which is Patrick Wilson's character. I'm sure many men go through what he does. Maybe not to that much of an extreme like the movie..... but similar.And Katherine Heigl as Mona was great too!!!It's just a good & simple little story, funny and dangerous. Nothing too crazy but definitely something good to watch if you're bored.I'm someone that, if I like something? I'll watch it again in a year or something.. movies & tv shows. I like to end my reviews with mentioning if this is something I'd re-watch or not. This isn't something I'd watch in a year again because a year wouldn't be enough time for me to forget everything that happened in the movie. But maybe two years down the line I could because it's just a good time-passer type of movie. Simple in a way, but good."
" Patrick Wilson
",2020-05-19 00:00:00,9,This is definitely a black comedy. Twisted but funny. I love anything Patrick Wilson does.
" It's actually pretty hilarious
",2020-01-02 00:00:00,8,"The critics were wrong with this movie. It's pretty funny. The actors do a good job playing their roles. The comedy's shocking yet still funny. The scenes where Mona has to get dirty and bully everyone around her are one of the worst and yet funny scenes. I really like the Chi McBride's deadpan delivery. The songs are pretty catchy as well. Particularly the song ""More Than The Moon And The Stars"" by Josh Kelley. If you like Dark Comedy's check it out."
" I think Katherine Heigl is fabulous in this movie
",2019-12-15 00:00:00,10,I think Katherine Heigl plays this character so well its so believable I love this movie! Watched it several times now would recommend
" my notes
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,6,"Very different and weird with the story taking you places you never expected. lots of surprising parts. Some funny parts but also dragged at times. the flow was a little inconsistent at times, I wasn't really sure where the climax was. Great acting job by Katherine Heigel... (1 viewing)
SPOILERS
playing a crazy woman with ocd perfectly. I liked the endings as well"
" Funny, Dark, and LIght.
",2018-08-22 00:00:00,9,"Don't fret; if you're looking for a dark comedy with genuine laughs and some sinister behaviour, look no further.
Its not a true story or a documentary, just a wicked good time.
All performances were spot on
And, Katherine Heigl is not hard on the eyes.
8.5 rounded up to 9"
" This is NOT dark comedy
",2018-08-21 00:00:00,3,"...that was just a lousy try. Yes, I saw death, blood and murder, but that try of humour was so sad it's tragic!"
" MORE THAN THE MOON AND STARS
",2018-07-18 00:00:00,8,"Don Champagne (Patrick Wilson) appears to live the ideal life, at least the ideal life his wife Mona (Katherine Heigl) desires. She has their life planned and keeps a scrap book ""goal book"" which she reads religiously. If by some stupid chance you peeked at the DVD cover, you know she will do anything to keep her life on an even keel. However, there appears a boat rocker to her plans. Our happy couple has sex 6 times a year and only when it is on the calendar. Don hires major league babe Dusty (Jordana Brewster - I need to watch D.E.B.S. again.) who throws herself at him causing blackmail complications that can only have the expected final solution. ""There is ever only my way.""Yes. this is another quirky housewife psycho killer film, most of which were a bit better, which is not to say this wasn't entertaining. The kids provided a good side story of competing siblings with the boy Andrew (Aiden Flowers) losing out to Alison (Madison Wolfe) to the dismay of dad. They needed to have one or two mores scenes with the kids to make for a good subplot and to help establish character and maybe bring out that which we may not speak, because gutting and dismemberment is an option.Would make for an excellent rental or one to add to your nice quirky killer collection. People who like this film might want to check out ""Miss Meadows.""Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Steffie Grote, Catherine Ashton + background strippers)"
" Ignore the Hate
",2018-07-02 00:00:00,8,"Remove your wanna be critic shoes for a minute and enjoy this movie for what it is; just a goofy fluff of a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and neither should any of us. Just like in an action movie where the star gets punched kicked shot at, and makes a car do things that are just impossible, suspend belief for 90 minutes and allow yourself to be entertained. Then feel free to go watch Citizen Kane when you're ready for a grandiose cinematic masterpiece."
" dark comedy made me laugh
",2017-10-31 00:00:00,9,"not a critic but id like to say that 2 songs from house md made it to this movie, i loved it, dark jokes made me laugh the whole movie long. i know i should hate something but i don't. it s not the best movie of all time and i don't know why, but i cant find anything bad about it. it s funny actors i hate did well in it, and i like the story."
" Who Do I Root For?
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,7,"'Home Sweet Hell' is the epitome of a film that will never be watched by the mainstream. In fact, I'm surprised in these days of the dollar, this film ever got made in the first place. That's not because it's bad, it's just because it's so 'non mainstream' that I'm surprised anyone ever thought it would make a profit. However, I'm glad it was made regardless of how much it earned when it (no doubt!) went straight to DVD (or Netflix - wherever!).The reason I feel that it would never be considered 'mainstream' is that the central characters are fundamentally unlikable. We're introduced to a professional couple (Patrick Wilson and Katherine Heigl) - he is a weak-willed, spineless excuse of a man who is desperate to have an affair with anything in a skirt. She is a controlling, cold-hearted harpy of a woman. And, as I mentioned, when he finally gets 'lucky' enough to have an affair with an attractive employee, you know it's never going to end well. Let's just say that what follows is a twisted tale of blackmail, murder and double-crossing.Now, those are traits you may expect from the film's villains (of which there are also the 'traditional' type who come in the form of a pair of meth-heads). However, the fact that those we're supposed to root for, i.e. Wilson and Heigl, also display those - ahem - 'admirable little traits, mean these are hardly your regular 'heroes.' Some may claim that they could be called 'anti-heroes,' however they do little to earn this label, as they're hardly fighting the forces of darkness for the good of mankind, merely to save their own skins (and reputations!). I know Wilson comes across as slightly more sympathetic, as he really does find himself victimised by everyone and you can sort of see why he had an affair when you catch a glimpse of his homelife. James Belushi is a nice guy in the story, but he's just an additional character who we never really get to know.Now, please don't think I'm coming across as 'harsh' on this film - I actually quite liked it! In these days of selfless heroes (many of which in costumes swinging through cities and fighting hordes of alien bad-guys!) I quite enjoyed watching a pair of real nasty people being pitted against those equally distasteful - it made a pleasant change not to care who wins, only enjoying seeing as many people fail as possible. Yes, they say that you need to 'relate' to characters in order to understand their plight and therefore invest in their journey. I'm pleased to say I don't really relate to any of them and I still enjoyed the - darkly disturbing and sometimes comic- ride. If you're in the mood for something distinctly UNheroic and dark, then this one should kill an hour and a half of your time."
" Heigl Shines As A Sadist in This Murderous Black Comedy
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,10,"This scintillating black comedy about a married couple where the wife rules the house is refreshing hilarity. Katherine Heigl is cast as Mona Champagne, a ball-breaking wife who denies her husband sex unless she has scheduled coitus on her calendar. Patrick Wilson is simply brilliant as Heigl's milquetoast husband Don Champagne who runs a furniture store. He hires a drop-dead gorgeous saleslady, Dusty (Jordana Brewster of ""The Fast and the Furious""), with whom he winds up in an extramarital affair until she informs him that she is pregnant. As it turns out, Dusty works as an accomplice to two murderous meth head desperadoes, Murphy (A.J. Buckley of ""Zombie Hamlet"") and Freeman (Kevin McKidd of ""Trainspotting""), and they plan to blackmail Don. In an earlier scene, we saw Murphy and Freeman take advantage of another man who appears to be dead. Anyway, Don's one and only employee before he hired the sexually outgoing Dusty, Les (Jim Belushi of ""Red Heat""), decided to give her $13-thousand dollars. Don's paranoia about the consequences of his affair prompts him to throw himself on the mercy of Mona, and she concocts a scheme whereby she is administer a Mickey Finn into Dusty's drink when the latter comes to see Don about the money. Naturally, Don is frightened at the prospect of Dusty dying from Mona's drink. Don is marginally relieved when Dusty revives just long enough for Mona to slug her with a hammer. Afterward, Mona dons a gown and cuts Dusty's corpse up with a wood-working appliance. She luxuriates in the splatter of Dusty's blood as she mutilates her lifeless body. Later, she has Don drive her over to Dusty's trailer where she stuffs Dusty decapitated head in the freezer. While she is shoving Dusty's body parts into the fridge, Freeman and a hooker surprise her while she is in the trailer. Mona displays no qualms about taking a samurai sword away from the witless girl and skewering her with it like a shish kebab. The dim-witted Freeman doesn't recognize Mona for a moment and she stabs him repeatedly with a knife until he crumples into his own pool of blood. Murphy is considerably upset when he comes home to the trailer and finds Freeman and the girl sliced and diced in their own reservoirs of blood. Emerging triumphant from her double-murder, Mona warns their gay neighbors about their frisky little dog that encroaches on the Champagne's home. She threatens to kill the little doggie if it ever ventures back onto their premises. One evening while they are preparing to bed, Mona warns Don that she has two deadly knives in her bedside cabinet that she will wield to carve him up if he displeases her. A shocked Don doesn't know what to do until he finds the poor little doggie in their own freezer, and he comes up with a plan to kill his wife that reminded me of the Michael Caine black comedy ""A Shock to the Systerm"" where he rigged up a booby trap that will electrocute his wife. Don fixes it so that the lightning fixture in their garage will spark up when she switches it on, and the gas leaking from two propane container will ignite. As Don is walking away from a party at their residence, the entire garage blows up.Director Anthony Burns and scenarists Carlo Allen, Ted Elrick, and Tom Lavagnino have created a flawlessly funny R-rated film that benefits from a light touch. Katherine Heigl is both wicked and clever as the domineering dame who emasculates her husband without a qualm. She treats their son with equal contempt but dotes on her intelligent daughter. Watching Heigl relish the prospect of cutting up a corpse is something that you don't always seen this lightweight comic pull off with her tongue-in-cheek. Burns and company never make a error in plotting the downfall of not only Dusty but also Murphy's accomplices. Everything is done with a wink and ""Home Sweet Hell"" lives up to its title and is a drastic change of pace for Heigl. If you are a Heigl fan, you don't want to miss ""Home Sweet Hell."""
