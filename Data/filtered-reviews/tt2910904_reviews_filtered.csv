" Very unexpected
",2021-04-08 00:00:00,9,"During this movie you keep thinking: ""it will get better."" But it just keeps getting worse and worse. And that's the best thing about this movie."
" A surprisingly good Australian film than many others
",2021-04-03 00:00:00,7,"To be honest I wasn't quite sure if this is the kind of film I would like to watch as Australian films are largely second rate or even third rate compared to their American or British counterparts. Part of the reason I did choose to watch is the A-lister cast such as Kate Winslet and Liam Hemsworth.And I'm glad I made it to the end. Hilarious, ironic, surprising yet revealing are probably the most summarizing words I can use to describe this show.The storyline seems a bit flat at the beginning. Yet it starts to unfold as the show goes on. An apparently innocent girl was sent to exile for an alleged murder she has never committed only as a result of personal persecution by her birth father and various people who care only about their own jobs and who dare not speak out. The girl made a return to the town in her adulthood trying to win the heart and mind of the locals. Yet this is how the irony unfolds. People are all animals of stereotypes and once they make a judgment it's very hard to reverse that course. Unrelenting and ungrateful, isn't that we all are?There are many hilarious scenes in the show such as Gertrude running away from her initial dressmaker reminiscing of the Runaway Bride (1999), the melodramatic drowning of the chemist and the cross dressing sergeant. All add up to the spices of its comedy genre.One thing I must point out is that the surprising scenes and endings such as the sudden death of Teddy (Liam Hemsworth). I was expecting the pair would happily marry and settle for life after some courtship and romance. But I guess surprise is one of the many things movies rely on. And the burning down of Tilly's own house and the entire town thereafter comes as a total surprise to me as I would have thought the townspeople had moved on from their past wrongs. Oh well, nothing is impossible when it comes to movies, is it?Overall this film reveals the sarcastic human nature as I have summarized. And yet all the larger-than-life aspects of a film would never be accomplished without accomplished actors without whom the movie would look like a dry Valencia orange without juice. Hollywood juggernauts like Kate Winslet, Liam Hemsworth and Hugo Weaving together with Australian queen of the silver screen Judy Davies undoubtedly added a fair bit of additive on the plate. Winslet is so British and classy in Titanic (1997) and she obviously carried that on to this movie as a fashion designer. Liam Hemsworth is strikingly masculine and handsome just as his older brother Chris Hemsworth. What a seasoned movie family! And Hugo Weaving proves he can do more than Lord of the Rings and Matrix. Noteworthy is the local Australian actress Judy Davies. She clearly performed the volatile and at times morbid character as Tilly's mother very vividly.One last thing as I always review a show is its location. It is filmed in the outback of country Victoria with red rocks and bone dry earth which creates a very stark contrast to the seaside harbor city of Sydney where I live. It is such a beautiful visual shock.All in all The Dressmaker (2015) is a standout from its many mediocre or even inferior Australian peers. Well done team!"
" Disgraceful
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,3,"Poor acting. Not worth the time to watch. 15 mins into the movie it shows a man giving his partner a strong dose of sleep meds, then as soon as he knows she's out, he screws her... totally taking advantage of her without her knowledge. Disgusting. Is that how we want women to be viewed? As objects for men to do whatever they want? There's enough of that going on in the world. Why do the directors of this movie have to Display and condone that type of behavior? Pathetic. #RespectWomen."
" Great surprise!
",2021-03-26 00:00:00,8,"This reminds of how I felt when I watched ""Babe"". Quirky, engaging, a little dangerous, some dark humor, and gorgeous against a bleak sepia-toned world. Great characters. What a wonderful surprise."
" A Bizarre and Tragic Movie
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,2,"If you want to spend a couple of hours watching hollywood cliches woven into an overly theatrical and bizarre storyline and group of characters, then this is for you. Not to mention the negative and tragic slant to the entire movie. I like dark humor but this was interrupted by manufactured drama and just strange characters. I suppose a shirtless Liam Hemsworth gets the movie some high ratings though, and Kate Winslet is always great. But my God. I guess this is what qualifies as deep, dramatic and dark comedy now. Sad."
" Vulgar, tasteless and inconsistent.
",2021-02-17 00:00:00,2,Funny when it's trying to be tragic. Tragic when it's trying to be funny. Is that the point? No idea.
" This movie was not my cup of tea
",2021-02-11 00:00:00,5,"Based on the other reviews, I think that this movie is just not to my personal taste. I don't disagree with anything that any of the positive reviews, I just didn't like it. For me, not enough comedy, not my type of comedy, too many feelings for not enough of anything else going on. I just picked the wrong movie to watch. See it for yourself, and see if it's your taste. The cast is fantastic, and most of them are doing great."
" Unexpectedly enjoyable.
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,8,"This film is just how it is described with an overall unexpected and enjoyable experience. Some scenes are extremely graphic and disturbing at the same time. The story line is familiar and relatable. The setting is Australia, although the timing is not clear (50s, 60s maybe?)."
" Quirky and offbeat!
",2021-01-22 00:00:00,8,"Not what I was expecting but still thoroughly enjoyed it. Be prepared for quirky, unusual and offbeat and then you won't be disappointed and give it an unfairly low rating.The plot is strong and unfolds well, it's the unique characters (played by an excellent cast) that give it an edge amongst so many other run-of-the-mill films.Even better the second time I watched it."
" DÃ¼rrenmatt's ""The Visit"" goes to Australia and puts on a dress.
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,6,"Jocelyn Moorhouse's film is based on the novel by Rosalie Ham, who seemed to have loved Friedrich DÃ¼rrenmatt 'The Visit' very, very much, in school(?), and placed it in Australia, taking away everything that made that post-WWII revenge drama play dark, watering it down and adding her own drapes to it.The movie has it's Aussie charm and humor, while the story is occasionally dabbling in the 'dark past' (you all really should read ""The Visit"" - not sure about Rosalie Ham's 'beststelling novel'), it also has the very light, utterly predictable 'romance' part (between Liam Hamsworth and Kate Winslet).In the end, it's a comedy, more than a drama. Entertaining for the most part.Hugo Weaving gets to revisit ""The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"" (1994) in a different character.Watching Kate Winslet and Judy Davis bounce off, of each other, both giving marvelous performances, is a treat in itself, worth the 'virtual' movie ticket."
" I loved this movie
",2021-01-15 00:00:00,9,"Oh myðŸ™ƒ I will so more to tomorrow
I loved this moved
Oh my gawd
Just what I needed!"
" Unique
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,9,"A stellar Mrs. Kate Winslet shows (yet again) the complete spectrum of human emotions. Touching, witty, charming, classy, dramatic, loving... and sinister. A wonderful, faceted story and an equally wonderful cast (Mr Hugo Weaving in particular), beautifully painted pictures and a perfectly matching score create quite a special movie which doesn't fit into a specific genre - same as the lead character - Tilly is different, unique and so is the dressmaker."
" Beautiful film, brilliantly acted and directed.
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,10,"I decided to watch The Dressmaker after watching the preview, and I was certainly not disappointed. Part murder mystery, part dark comedy, The Dressmaker will take you on an emotional rollercoaster ride, alternately making you lose faith in humanity, then regain it.Kate Winslet is breathtaking in her portrayal of Tillie Dunnage, a dressmaker with a mysterious past who grew up in a small, remote Australian town. Judy Davis is equally amazing as her mother, Molly Dunnage, an elderly woman over whom life has run roughshod. Hugh Laurie is his usual brilliant self, playing the town's policeman in public and a fashionista in private. And Liam Hemsworth is perfect as Tillie's love interest, Teddy, and manages to be both tough and gentle. The supporting cast did a fine job as the buttresses to the main players, believable characters all.The town is a veritable rubbish can of humanity, showcasing all of humanity's worst vices. The townspeople not only keep their secrets, they rewrite their history to cover their sins. Both Tillie and her mother have been victims of this self-delusional practice, to their detriment. When the secrets begin to be revealed one by one, the town will be irrevocably changed. And so will Tillie.Caveat: I have not read the book on which this film is based."
" Brilliant
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,9,"Kate Winslet is amazing. Liam Hemsworth complemented Kate's performance. The story is strange, but I was glued to it."
" That was whack
",2020-12-30 00:00:00,6,"It was an interesting tale, give it a shot. I think it'll hit different depending on who you are/how high you are. Best performance by that guy from the Matrix"
" Great movie
",2020-12-18 00:00:00,8,This movie hits on all the emotions and I really liked it.
" Excellent Mystery!
",2020-12-14 00:00:00,10,I love this story!! The cast is excellent!! Its a love story/mystery!! Funny and sad!! Have watched it several times and will probably watch it again!! The writer of the story had a keen sense of a small town attitude and judgement!!
" Stupid movie
",2020-12-06 00:00:00,5,Crazy at first the ending is the only good part.they are nuts in the movie
" Such a fun film
",2020-12-04 00:00:00,9,This film is a one part whimsical and two parts dark humour tale. The cast of characters are all excellent but Judy Davis as the eccentric mother really shines. Cate Blanchette plays a fancy dressmaker who returns to her roots in Dungatar Australia in the hopes of answering some questions. The plain town folks soon find themselves calling on the dressmaker to liven their wardrobes. Their need for fashion trumps the fact the whole town blamed her as a child for the death of a boy. I teared up in parts but mostly laughed all the way through this film. Really best to watch with no expectations and just let it take you on the ride.
" Hi I'm Tilly and my life... is kinda crazy.
",2020-12-01 00:00:00,7,A woman once wronged returns to her birth place and ruins everyone's life. Not the romcom I was expecting. More a dark- not quite black- comedy. Hits a few genres. It has one of the most hand over mouth omg no! moments I've had in awhile. Kate Winslet is good as always as the flawed angsty woman though it's hard not to notice she's much older than her supposed peers. Judy Davis is a treasure and a great character actor. Liam Hemsworth has that likability factor - lots of handsome blokes in this film- but again the age difference ( 15 years) with KW is pretty strange. They're supposed to be the same age. Still very good.
" Unnecessarily traumatic
",2020-11-12 00:00:00,4,"This could have been a nice film about a woman's talent transforming a village, that is what I thought it would be. Instead, it became a Tarantino-esq series of dramatic events which left me annoyed. Maybe some would like that, I did not."
" Overrated mess
",2020-10-25 00:00:00,3,"I've been on an Aussie film binge of late and came across this one which is supposedly a modern classic. It's actually an overrated mess - not sure whether it wants to be black comedy, a drama, a romance, or a quirky slice-of-life study that the Aussies do so well. It's all over the place and up being nothing, other than an overly long, confusing bore-fest. Boring 'plot', boring shallow characters, boring romance, boring twists and revelations, boring dialogue. Some of the dresses were nice and Hugo Weaving was intriguing as a cross-dressing copper, hence 3 stars. But I struggled to make it to the end and had completely lost interest about 2/3s in. Avoid."
" Weirdly-written Plot but Good Acting
",2020-07-23 00:00:00,5,"It's starts out as a badly written romantic comedy and after Liam Hemsworth' death it just gets... weird. Like a super weird, revenge-ridden, comedic thriller (like DÃ¼rrenmatt in Australia with nice dresses). The acting is great however, and I loved the setting and costume-design."
" A brilliant emotional rollercoaster
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,8,"The Dressmaker is a very powerful movie, that will spark almost every one of the viewer's emotions. The film manages to keep you captivated from the very beginning and as you go through, you will constantly find yourself feeling everything so intense. From empathy to loathing and compassion to despair. Every scene is made carefully and gorgeously. Magnificent cinematography embellished with exquisite music. Literally, it contains everything from plot twists and strong meanings behind scenes. Kate Winslet is absolutely stunning, makes the best out of her role and even becomes an inspiration. Although there is a great cast, Kate stands out with her amazing performance.
The only thing I find a bit disappointing, is that there is no chemistry between Kate Winslet and Liam Hemsworth, they were a bit odd together. At the movie, they supposed to be of similar age -or at least 3-5 years apart- but the difference between them is more than obvious.
At the end of the day, I believe this is a wonderful movie with substantial meanings that totally worth watching and falling in love with."
" Very well made
",2020-07-17 00:00:00,9,This is a must watch. One of my favorite films. A very different story.
" Yikes
",2020-07-06 00:00:00,2,"The acting was good but I could not get into this story. I think it lacked depth and felt rushed. I was often thinking ""Did I miss something? Did I fall asleep and miss why this happened?"" I could not get into the romantic relationship either and I love romance."
" ""You've never met the rubbish""
",2020-06-30 00:00:00,8,"Every now and again I come back to watch this picture, it's very personal and relatable to me. I too used to grow up being the blacksheep of my community for my sexuality. Everybody in every nook and cranny hassles me and my family off for having a gay son, and mind you it was not a religious community, they just discriminated because they simply didn't like it. Then a few years later after I left that town, I became successful and have made a name for myself and going places, so I decided one summer to return back to that town to tend to my mother and grandmother still living there and still being hissed at by the local townspeople. Having seen me back, they saw clearly how much I changed inside and out, from the way I talk and think to the way I dress. Just like Tilly in the story, I was the one who stood out among the rest of the average folks in terms of how I look. And yet, my notoriety never left the local consciousness of them and I was being gossiped and looked at with strange mockery eyes. Still, I am now a grown up and wanted to contribute to this little town no matter how much they unreasonably despises me. They are now benefited from my success and financials and began taking advantage of me when it comes to asking for favor, but outside of favors, their distaste towards me never shifted. Just like in the film, my grandmother sadly passed away during my visit and my mom refuses to leave for she has become too accustomed to the town no matter how cruel they are. But I left and I brought all the benefits I helped for my town with me because I soon realized they don't deserve it. Just like the townspeople in the film, the townspeople in my town were also brass, shallow, gossiping, lustful for luxury, greedy, vindictive, malicious, and nasty (I even had a teacher like Miss Beula Harridene). I wish I could have left the town in sweet revenge like Tilly did in the film. But that's why, by and large, as you can see this picture really connects with me, a lot of the events mirror my own experience and I shared above. Some people dislike the picture understandably because they cannot connect with the character and the story, but I find it very empathetic because if the story speaks to you personally then it is much easier to connect with it."
" ""Australia"" meets the last season of ""Game of Thrones""
",2020-06-24 00:00:00,3,"No amount of skilled acting can save a movie that felt like it was still being written as they filmed it. The initial conflict was resolved about half way in, so they start killing of characters in cliche, gimmicky ways to try to Frankenstein a full length film out of a weak idea."
" Such an unexpected and brilliant story!
",2020-06-23 00:00:00,8,"You know how people sometimes say ""That movie is a bit like..."" well this movie isn't a bit like anything else. I will ramble on for a while here but since you probably are mostly curious about why I didn't give it a 9 or a 10 I want to start with that; it's just that for me it didn't spark very deep emotions. I'm a very emotional person and if I don't get the feels, I can't give it my top rating.Soundtrack is a big emotion trigger for me and I think this movie lacks a bit in that department. I can't remember any of the music - and I just finished watching it.Now I rarely write reviews, but this one just has to be promoted.
If you like movies with multiple twists this is a must-watch for you! I haven't read the novel (I didn't even know it was based on one until I came here) so everything in this movie took me by surprise.The actors were absolutely amazing, so was of course all the costumes.
I'm not one who is very into fashion, so I was afraid that this movie might be too much fashion-focused for me. But it definitely isn't like that.
Every character felt ""real"" and the actors really put their soul in their character.Now I can't really say much about the story progression without spoiling, so the only thing I want to say is that it kept me surprised and entertained the whole time. It's a real rollercoaster, and I love that.This movie is one of those that I will happily rewatch if it was to introduce it to a friend, but not one that I would watch over and over like I do for example Titanic.And on that note; Kate Winslet isn't only Rose in my head, now she's also Tilly."
" Disastermaker
",2020-06-19 00:00:00,1,"After watching this movie, I decided to make profil on imbd because high grade here confused me and made me watch this 2 hours of disaster.
In the beginning, I will say that costumes were nice and that the role of crazy mother was perfectly played.
Everything else just didnt make any sense.First thing is Kate Winslets age. She truly is one of the kind, beautiful woman but she simply cant pass as a woman of 25 who swoops the whole football team with her body. Also, its hard to follow the plot in which she is at least 10 years older than every other actor who is playing her former classmates.Second thing is the genre of this piece. Through the movie, its hard to follow whats happening (and to actually believe in it) because it looks like director couldnt decide whether to make drama, comedy or thriller so they decided to make all of it in 2 hours piece. In the end, it turned out into a movie thats neither funny, mysterious nor touching in any way.Third problem adds to genre and its storyline.
In the less than two hours, main character plans revenge and then all of the sudden wants to be accepted in community, finds out did she kill her neighbour in the childhood and then literally nothing happens with this info, gets boyfriend and he dies 5 min later but none of that interested me one bit because of horrible writing.
In the end, please spare yourself time and watch some better work of Kate Winslet- God knows there are plenty of those."
" Another with that contrast
",2020-06-01 00:00:00,6,Another movie with quite a contrast between some really great aspects and elements versus some really terrible ones. It's too bad that they made even the good things into empty things and disturbing things. They almost had something great. But as it was I struggled between choosing 5 stars or 6 stars. I hope to find more writers (and movie makers in general) with more heart and soul.
" Nice movie ðŸŽ¥
",2020-05-18 00:00:00,10,"A bit of a dark comedy/ reality check for me. Got me thinking at Quentin Tarantino movies style.
It is a nice and courageous thing that the main character came back to face her demons and find out the truth about her childhood life.
The movie has life learning lessons- another one being about never mingle with the wrong crowd because it gets you nowhere."
" A good movie but not a masterpiece
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,6,"I love Kate Winslet ans she performed a great acting again. But Liam was a wrong choice to play his role because he seemed too ypung to talk about 25 years ago because he is already 25!! I give importance to these details too much in a film. The film went between comedy and drama but could not catch both in my opinion. In many scenes there was absurd events. Some people claim that it should be nominated for Oscar but come on,this script is a little eak and not so deeply handled."
" Terrible Aussie Flick
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,1,"I saw the movie Australia starring Nicole Kidman, well this Classic wannabe rates up their with it. Kate Winslet a great actress who played Rose in Titanic, a disaster movie was unaware that this movie The Dressmaker would be an even greater disaster in my opinion than Titanic. Nothing redeeming in this movie at all, so slow it would put you to sleep with boardem, cardboard characters with no entertainment value. Worthy of this low rating, the 1 is for the outback scenery, the rest deserves a zero. My tip forget it, give it a big miss."
" Fantastic
",2020-03-01 00:00:00,9,"I'm not a fan of Kate winslet, but she nails this part . And Judy Davis is a treasure ! A great watch ,so entertaining"
" A FEST FOR EYE AND EARS
",2020-02-27 00:00:00,9,"Wow! What a brilliant movie! Admittedly a bit skewed, a bit exaggerated probably, a bit grotesque, but what a show, what outstanding acting, fantastic soundtrack, brilliant pictures, beautiful dresses! It got 4 AACTA awards and they were well deserved: best costumes, best supporting actor+actress (Hugo Weaving and Judy Davis), best actress (Kate Winslet). Nominee in many more categories. But the Oscars missed it out completely lol. What a beauty is Kate Winslet? Not in a modern, easily forgotten way. In the classic way! She's a feast for the eyes and so is her acting."
" Oh dear!
",2019-11-23 00:00:00,1,Fell asleep part way through. A terrible movie not deserving of some good actors.
" So conflicted
",2019-11-14 00:00:00,8,"So well done and acted, but terribly heart wrenching."
" Like a bad train wreck that you can't stop watching
",2019-11-02 00:00:00,3,"Within the first 5 minutes, I knew this was going to be a bad movie. I'll admit, though, that I watched the whole thing. It was like a bad train wreck that I couldn't stop watching. The story line and the characters are just plain awful. It reminded me of a really bad Peyton Place with a town of barely two dozen people where every single of of the town's inhabitants needs to be checked into a loony bin. One thing that isn't quite right about the description of the movie is that it's supposedly about a woman who comes back to her childhood town where she takes revenge on those that did her wrong. Well that is NOT what happens in the movie. The woman comes back believing that she murdered a kid when she was 10, but she has no recollection of it. It's more like she comes back to find answers. In the beginning struggles with some of the town folks, but they warm up to her because she makes them look pretty and fancy in our dresses that she designs and sews. But then all hell breaks loose when this evil old hag reminds the town that she killed a boy when she was 10 and even though it isn't true the whole town goes off on her. But then when the town wants to win some goofy talent show contest they come back to her asking for her help to make them pretty again and she basically tells them to get lost. In the end she helps the people from the neighboring town win the competition and while the people in her town are fuming mad and head back to town she in the meantime has set fire to the whole place and moves to Paris. So in other words she didn't kill anyone and yet she's made out to be the bad person and in the end she kind of was when she burned the town down. It didn't make any sense. Why burn the town. You've been the victim throughout this whole movie and suddenly in the end you're going to prove to everyone that they were right about how bad you are? Give me a break!"
" Great film with great acting.
",2019-08-17 00:00:00,10,As usual Kate Winslet was amazing. The story was excellent and really quite dark but I loved it all. It seems to cover the book well
" Wonderfully surprising!
",2019-07-02 00:00:00,10,"Put simply, I was not expecting this movie to be quite as fantastic as it is! The performance from the cast as a whole is fantastic and seeing so many Australian actors in such a great film is always great. I could watch this over and over again."
" Too weird for me
",2019-06-13 00:00:00,1,"In this quirky Australian drama, a woman in the 1950s returns to her small hometown with a sewing machine and a grudge. When she was a child, many people in the town either participated in a great wrong done to her or stood idly by as it happened, and she wants to make them pay. While parts of the movie appear very fluffy and silly, it's always clear there's a very dark tone ready to surface at any moment.I didn't make it through the entire movie, as it became too strange for me to enjoy. Kate Winslet attends a rugby match and takes off her clothes, glad when the players are distracted enough to crash into each other. That's her revenge? She gives a homely girl a makeover only to show her ugliness at the right time so her boyfriend doesn't want her anymore. That's her revenge? Obviously not, and these events are just building to something more sinister later in the film. I didn't have the patience to see what sort of evil revenge scheme she really had in mind, but if you like those types of movies, you can try it out. It was just far too weird for me.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due mature subject matter, I wouldn't let my kids watch it."
" Pretty much a waste of time
",2019-05-08 00:00:00,2,"I watched this on Amazon prime video...very glad I didn't pay to see this disappointing movie. Winslet is too old for this role, even though she is beautiful and looks amazing in her dresses...as does everyone else who wears one of her character's creations.I've not read the book, but the characters in the film were as unbelievable as the plot. Tilly comes back for revenge armed with a....sewing machine? She was wronged by a town that believed she committed a murder she couldn't remember? Until she did, helped by an unbelievable heart-of-gold impossibly handsome guy? How convenient!The tiny town in the middle of nowhere was made of a lot of dirt, some corrugated tin, and enough wood to make it flammable. And the originally frumpy female inhabitants just somehow wanted to dress to the nines every freaking day? You know, right after the hated Tilly comes back wearing Paris couture fashion? Of course they would want to emulate someone they hated.Only two people witnessed the (flashback) incident when the boy died of a broken neck...and the one who remembered how it REALLY happened was the ""slow brother ""? Of course.And speaking of this ""slow"" brother of Liam's character...why does HE know what's in the silo (sorghum which apparently will not support a person but will swallow and suffocate that person), but Liam's character doesn't know this when he jumps in and dies, trying to prove to Tilly that she is NOT cursed? Who's the slow brother now? Sorry...a completely stupid plot twist, to me. And he wouldn't have jumped in and died had she only uttered ""I am not cursed!""...she has a few minutes of grief but no angst over guilt? Then she gets on with her revenge...sorry, just not believably portrayed.The cross dressing cop....come on! No one in the tiny dusty town knew? BS plot device.The Clint Eastwood style western music falls flat. It's just out of place...if this was supposed to be a female version of High Plains Drifter, it failed.Maybe I should read the book to see what the movie was trying to portray.Or maybe that will be several more hours of time wasted."
" A ""Modiste"" Movie
",2019-04-18 00:00:00,6,"Wouldn't be an Australian movie without a little cross dressing, drab small town intrigue and a hunky Hemsworth (this time it's Liam). 'The Dressmaker' is charming enough and well acted (Sarah Snook steals a scene or two) but Kate Winslet's performance is as beige and dry as the outback fictional town the movie takes place in. Winslet's gift is her ability to fill even the most pedantic of characters with an oozing creamy ribald sensuality. Yet, there is little if any chemistry between her and Hemsworth. Hugo Weaving and Judy Davis are left to do the heavy lifting which they do admirably. A box office success when first released in Australia which begs the question: What do I know? Well, I know there is something missing. Maybe Hugh Grant? (I'd say ""or a Hugh Grant type"" but there isn't such a thing. We miss ya', Hugh.) The drama seems confined and forced almost as if the story would have been better suited as a metatheatre play. The result is just an okay little movie."
" Chic delivery of village-wide karma
",2019-01-17 00:00:00,9,"Loved this film. I have watched it several times. I find I often enjoy Australian films. They have their own charm and idiosyncrasies, but still appealing to those of us raised on Hollywood. There are plot twists and surprises; laughs and places you'll want to cry. Beauty, beefcake, and a few bravura performances."
" All dressed up and nowhere to go
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,3,"Some Australian movies can be very Australian, but easily exportable and loved all around the world (Strictly ballroom, Priscilla, Muriel's wedding). They mix great costumes and locations with social commentary and produce great results. The same cannot be said for this one.It starts well, with Kate Winslet as Tilly, going back home to her little village in the Australian outback. This is the 50s, but the scene works as a Western, with the hero getting off the train in a dusty town, armed only with his courage and a gun. Tilly is armed with a sewing machine. She is a great seamstress and she is here to rescue Molly, her mother, from the village and to find the truth about what happened during her childhood.So far so good, but then we're presented with a cast of equally despicable villagers, all bent to dislike and hate Tilly and Molly. The latter is played by Judy Davis, an actress I usually like, but found way over the top in this movie. Molly has allegedly forgotten everything that happened to her daughter and claims not to even recognised her.The whole ""revenge"" plot is then derailed into an unlikely love story, which turns out to be a red herring. Tilly is still bent on revenge, but I could not stop wondering why she wasted so much time to work on her revenge and why instead of buying into her lover plan to leave the village with her mother ,when they could have....The whole story dragged on far too long, there is way too much screaming and Hugo Weaving's police sergeant is too much of a caricature, besides being a major time consuming plot device. Excellent costumes, though."
" Not Since Dogville!
",2019-01-11 00:00:00,9,"24 February 2017. The most intriguing aspect of this movie is its indescribability, like even more so than Dogville (2003). Is it a drama, a thriller, a mystery, or comedy? The cast of characters is varied and in some cases very stylistic, yet charmingly deceptive. In what might be considered one of the most difficult directorial and edited films, The Dressmaker abounds with treacherous tonality changes which could sink this movie by riddling it with psychologically conflicting backlashes making the movie almost impossible to watch.Kate Winslet offers up a superb performance and script twists manage to jar the audience with some amazing emotional transitions making The Dressmaker something closer to an entertaining psychological thriller with hidden mystery and whimsical humor. This is both a funny but darkly sad movie. The entire production is unique, well crafted and perfectly suited to the big screen. This is both a light but complex and intricate movie.Dark Shadows (2012), Margot at the Wedding (2007), Chocolat (2001) are other similar themed movies."
" must-see
",2019-01-11 00:00:00,10,"Honestly speaking, this movie, in my opinion has it all; it has, primarily a good plot, an awesome plot, it has romance, comedy, drama, action, emotion, good acting, it's unpredictable and it has a message. I've seen it three times by now in a three year span since it came out and everytime I notice something new and enjoy even more. It's truly an art piece. 10/10 would recommend."
" Gorgeous & intriguing

" Unexpectedly enjoyable!
",2018-12-26 00:00:00,7,"This movie was quite weird but I enjoyed it! It was not predictable at all as what I thought was going to be the ending, was not at all! Glad I took the time to check this one out!"
" A movie that should be seen
",2018-11-22 00:00:00,9,"The story revolves around a fashion designer who is a social outcast in her own village, trying to get her rights back from the society and her mother that made her leave to a far place. As the story unfolds, so does the truth about her past and the reason why she was forced to leave as a child.
It's a very emotional story with a great view of how society is unfair. Great acting, strong structure of the story, a very good scenario, a beautiful music, and an ending that satisfies the watcher while being realistic. It's a must watch. The movie deserves a higher attention and a much more attentive audience."
" Dressmaker? More like Depressmaker!
",2018-10-18 00:00:00,1,"Look... I get it. Life isn't all sunshine and rainbows. There are tragedies that happen in this existence. 
At the same time, watching 2 hours of ridiculous, nonsensical tragedies makes for a poor movie night. The plot is shallow and extremely underwhelming. The acting was okay, but with such juvenile chatacters you are never fully immersed. In a nutshell, I actually just quit watching 3/4 of the way through, and I'm not one who can easily do that. My recommendation is just to skip this movie altogether. Just saying..."
" Clunky Screenplay and Tone
",2018-10-04 00:00:00,3,"(Flash Review)A woman returns to a small and isolated rural town in Australia wearing a fashionable dress and carrying a Singer sewing machine. You quickly learn this woman was accused of murder as young school girl and has returned to visit her mother who the town has never liked; perhaps that is why they were quick to accuse her daughter. The townsfolk are suspect of her return but quickly warm to her as she creates and provides dresses for the women so they can get a leg up in a cross-town competition; seemed like they were too easily wooed by some well-sewn fashion if they still think of her as a murderer. There is also a miscasting for the romantic angle with Winslet being way too old to rekindle a school girl crush with a younger looking Hemsworth, which aside from that was also feebly written. Overall, it had a grating soundtrack, jarring and abrupt story flow including an unconvincing mix of tones and not good character management."
" Oh, Jocelyn Where Have You Been Hiding All These Years
",2018-09-23 00:00:00,9,"Jocelyn Moorhouse has made just five films in four decades of filmmaking. Her second feature PROOF is a modern masterpiece and this 2015 adaptation of a Rosalie Ham novel isn't far off that.This is probably Kate Winslet's finest hour thus far, playing the 'maybe' murderess Myrtle Dunnage, who returns to her vipers nest of a home town having reinvented herself as a purveyor of fine haute couture. Her return to the outback town of Dungatar is built upon the idea of exacting revenge upon a small population that wronged her and her mother (played with gleeful mania by an almost unrecognisable Judy Davis). The film opens like a Spaghetti western, and for good reason, for this is a jet black comedy modelled on HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER. Moorhouse has always had a blackly comic sensibility and fundamental affinity for the outsider. She is also that rarest of directors who is able to take risky tonal shifts in her stride. In THE DRESSMAKER things jump from the comic to the grotesque to the romantic to the tragic with all of the alacrity, poise and wit of a Preston Sturges or Rouben Mamoulian. The comedy is hilarious and the drama gut-wrenchingly harsh. Perhaps my only complaint with this slab of Australian weird cinema is that it has to end."
" A WASTE OF 2 HOURS
",2018-09-16 00:00:00,1,"Moronic drivel for the IQ challenged. This movie is moderately amusing for the first 40 minutes or so and then it isn't. The plot line and dialogue for the remaining segment appears to have been created by someone high on something. Overall, a very boring, dumb movie."
" A very entertaining combination of comedy, tragedy, mystery and drama
",2018-09-10 00:00:00,9,"I viewed this film because of the trailer, and Kate Winslet and I'm very glad I did. This film combines many different genres in a very entertaining way. On many occasions it's laugh out loud funny, and on other occasions it may cause you to tear up. Kate Winslet is inspiring beautiful and her acting is exceptional as ever. I have only seen Sarah Snook in a few films and had no idea that she was so hilarious. I had to rewind some of her scenes because they were just that entertaining. If you enjoyed Mean Girls of Devil Wears Prada, you may enjoy this film. It's a good reminder that any woman who deals with cattiness and the ugly side of women that you are not alone. Great film."
" Great Fun
",2018-08-21 00:00:00,9,"I'm definitely at odds with professional critics on this film.I watched it by chance, on Sky Cinema I think. I enjoyed it so much I bought the DVD and that is a rare thing for me to do.I'm not alone in loving The Dressmaker My elder and very discriminating, sister enjoyed it hugely too and I've recommended it to other close relatives and friends and they think it's great fun too.I love the quirkiness. The cast are brilliant and the dresses are truly, absolutely fabulous. I think my favourite scene is the women, wearing their fantastically out of place costumes, draping themselves in optimistically glamorous poses, in the main street. I don't care what the critics thought. I'm very glad I happened on this film and I can now watch it whenever the fancy takes me - depending only on access to a working DVD player.My DVD collection isn't large but it contains a mixture of comedy and historical drama mostly. Jane Austen dramatization dominate, TV series and films, plus some off shoots like The Jane Austen Book Club etc. CRANFORD, Wives and Daughters, are part of it too. With the odd Historical programmes, like Full Steam Ahead and Michael Woods, History of England. The Dressmaker joins those, with The Knight's Tale, Master and Commander, plus several series of QI."
" You better skip this!
",2018-08-17 00:00:00,5,It start like a classic one.Middle part is just comedy unrealistic type one.And at the end there is nothing.Which audience the producer try to catch?? The worst movie I've seen of Kate Winslet! Don't waste your time.

" A film should be airtight from beginning to end
",2018-06-19 00:00:00,3,"One false note and the whole thing collapses. Typically, scripts are edited and re-edited until your eyes fall out, and then re-edited some more. To draw you in, everything should be plausible and believable: Believable characters, believable storylines, believable situations. This film managed to keep its balls in the air until 1/3 of the way through, when our zaftig, middle-aged heroine waddles into the middle of a rugby game and distracts the players with a cocktail dress. More than likely these men would have been puzzled by the incongruity, not smitten with desire for a woman old enough to be their aunt. Okay, one sour note in the storyline, I guess I can keep watching. Then along comes the playground scene. Tilly begs her schoolmate not to tell where she's hiding. Come on, man. This is a town of not more than thirty people in the middle of nowhere, how in the world can she expect to keep hiding indefinitely? It makes zero sense. You people who automatically rated this film ten stars just because it stars Kate Winslet should have your head examined."
" A great script, perfectly acted and produced
",2018-06-17 00:00:00,10,A great script perfectly acted on all cylinders. Wonderfully drawn characters and a story perfectly told through the sometimes very comedic caricatures of the residents of a dusty middle of nowhere outback Australian town. Kate Winslet gives the kind of performance that made us fall in love with her years ago and Liam Hemsworth is every bit as dreamy as you imagine he would be but Hugo Weaving steals the show and Judy Davis is spectacular with her nuanced mad mum scenes. I happened upon this movie one afternoon and almost passed it by because I'm not a big fan of dirty dusty outback films but boy am I glad I watched this. Don't miss this wonderful film!
" Amazing
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,10,The plot the costumes the acting were all amazing. Kate Winslet is the total goddess in this movie.
" Revenge by means of a Singer sewing machine?
",2018-03-28 00:00:00,2,"Our over-the-hill heroine arrives in a tiny town with a little luggage and carrying a Singer sewing machine in a case. A sewing machine cannot be carried as we see it being done here. I'm strong for a female, and there is no way I could carry one as if it were a makeup case, as she does. That's the first red flag. Our heroine is also, very obviously, 15 (at least) years older than her contemporaries. She has come to town to get revenge on the townsfolk for a wrong done. Making dresses for the local ladies seems to be the way to accomplish this. Where does all this fabric come from? This is a tiny town out in the middle of nowhere and somehow all this fabric materializes (no pun intended) for all these dresses. Then out of nowhere another dressmaker shows up! Competition? Where is this story going? Romance? No chemistry there. He's handsome, yes. She's good looking. But wooden, both. He jumps into a silo of grain - we're shown this with the mice running around in it. Then we find out it was sorghum and he drowns in it. It's grain, then sorghum. Aaack! What else can happen in this screwy film? It could have been a good story with our heroine finding out what really happened when she was a child that caused her to be sent away, creating a relationship with a mother she's not seen in 25 years and maybe finding true love in the process. But it just did not work. Too many implausibles."
" Depressing but well done
",2018-03-21 00:00:00,8,Great acting by Judy Davis as Kate Winslet's mother. Depressing plot turns are somewhat offset by humorous characterizations and beautiful costumes.
" So much better than the trailers
",2018-03-01 00:00:00,10,"This movie is so much more intricate, complex and brilliant than the simple trailers show. It is a masterpiece with a wonderfully original screenplay, cinematography and direction - I've never seen anything quite like it. It feels like a cross between a Wes Anderson film and a Baz Luhrmann film, but toned down slightly. And then set in a forgotten era in a tiny outback town of Australia. But that hardly describes it. It is a unique, fresh, brand new slice of cinema that satisfies a craving you didn't you know you had! With outstanding, truly touching performances from Kate Winslet and the entire supporting cast, this film is hauntingly beautiful and unforgettable."
" weird collection of characters
",2018-01-05 00:00:00,6,"It's 1951. Fashionable Tilly Dunnage (Kate Winslet) returns to her rural hometown of Dungatar, Australia. Her delusional mother (Judy Davis) lives in their rundown family home. Twenty five years earlier, she was banished for suspicion of murder which she does not remember. She seeks the truth and revenge for the guilty. Teddy McSwiney (Liam Hemsworth) is a friendly neighbor. Sergeant Horatio Farrat (Hugo Weaving) is a cross-dresser.This is filled with a collection of strange characters. The movie is set to be a weird dark disturbing affair. I don't care that much about the dressmaking except for helping Tilly to solve the 25 year old case. I'm not always a fan of extensive flashbacks but this movie needs it. The most compelling aspect is the mystery of the boy's death. The movie is energized whenever Tilly starts solving the case. The present is less compelling than the past. The pacing does struggle at times. It takes a darker turn after solving the case. In a way, the movie starts anew after the climax which is often problematic. There are many issues. It tries to be quirky light comedy at times which fit uncomfortably with the dark material. This is possibly a better fit for a mini-series where the various twists can be given a cliffhanger and room to breathe. There are some great sections but it's bumpy ride."
" Unique and beautifully done
",2018-01-01 00:00:00,8,"I loved the contrast in this movie between the beauty of Kate Winslet and her dresses and the ugliness and dirtiness of the town. The dry, subtle humor reminded me of what I loved in the films ""Chocolat"" and ""Edward Scissorhands."" The charming weirdness of the town and its occupants kept me engaged throughout. And of course, as always, Kate Winslet was stunning, authentic, and addictive. I only wish that they would have let Teddy live. But, I guess that would have taken away the opportunity for rage and revenge at the end, so I guess I can see why they did it. Overall, I very much enjoyed the movie and thought it was very well done."
" Wish I had Seen it on the Big Screen
",2017-12-10 00:00:00,9,"When great care is taken with the cinematography and lighting, I want the big screen experience, but I avoided this film because the material did not grab me. It is immediately obvious they are using real film and that is rare, but what a treat! If one review had described the metamorphoses of the female forms and faces, I would have been there on opening night. That is no longer politically correct. The dress maker transforms rural hounds into breathtaking beauties with sexy dresses and super-hot make up. This happens in a backwards, rural town setting with a 1940's time flavor when glamour and man chasing was openly sanctioned. The story is good but the characters are the most fascinating bunch assembled in a long time and well played by all. Most will especially enjoy Winslet and Davis but all are good. The scoring is also great. See it for the sexual tension, raw beauty and love lessons."
" An excellent movie
",2017-11-27 00:00:00,9,"An excellent movie based on a novel which perfectly highlights one of the evils of our society that is, someone can be cursed and cause harm to others. Such a mindset in a society is itself a curse as amply highlighted in the movie. overall an excellent movie with Kate Winslet at her best acting."
" If Tim Burton Were Trapped In Australia For A Year
",2017-11-18 00:00:00,6,"The Aussie Outback is one of those lonesome frontiers, like the Arctic and the Southern American swampland, that we don't really see much in American cinema. We've had a few ""Max Max"" adventures and that 2008 film from Baz Luhrmann, but for the most part, its exploration is limited to indie films and foreign productions. And it's usually earnest and expansive, like ""The Rover"" taking on the wild Western genre, or it's scary and mined for horror, like in ""Kangaroo Jack"" -- wait, what was I talking about?""The Dressmaker"" drives Kate Winslet's titular seamstress Tilly out to the middle of nowhere, her way-out-back hometown where some unspeakable horror has occurred years ago. And supposedly, she's the perpetrator, though she doesn't remember. Neither does her senile, lunatic mother Molly (Judy Davis), who rambles about possums and presumably hasn't had a bath in years.There's weirdness afoot in town as well, where every character, from Hugo Weaving's delightful cross-dressing police sergeant to the hunchbacked chemist (mind you, it's the '20s), feels like a ""Twin Peaks"" small-town oddity on steroids.This is all helped along by the screwball execution of a rather dark story. Reminiscent of a Tim Burton film, there's slapstick antics and clever visual gags that shove a rocket up the ass of a considerably more somber tale of clearing one's innocence and seeking vengeance on some silly town gossips. Who says we can't have fun while we're exploring one woman's dark past?Well, the script, for one. Sometimes the story gets a little too deathly for its own good, and while writer/director Jocelyn Moorhouse knows when to slow down and let these moments breathe, much of the third act decides the film has been twiddling its thumbs for too long (it hasn't) and rushes forward with many shocking developments and hurried character beats.But what a strong first two acts! Moorhouse has a knack for zany scene construction, and the montages, arguments and introductions all bear the beautiful feeling of brevity. Tilly takes up the local trailer hunk (Liam Hemsworth) on his offer for a date. Fifteen seconds, tops. Tilly momentarily decides to give up dressmaking for good. Two minutes, in and out. Bam. Done. And while sometimes, this hampers the overall flow of the film, it sets up an exuberant tone out of the gate.The problems come with tone, and with how that energy can be kept up throughout the entire film. Moorhouse commits, thank goodness, to the wackiness, and she dials the Burtonosity of it all up to 11 for some inspired scenes on top of a silo at night, in a ostensibly innocent kitchen, or in a bride-to-be's frantic rush to Tilly's doorstep.The central relationships of Tilly with the hunky Hemsworth brother (sorry, was there more to his character that I was missing?) and with her mother are given ample attention, and we feel the weight they have in Tilly's life. Winslet's soulful performance cuts through her anxiety and fear with her smiles and her tenacity, which brighten up the first act and keep the fantastical, folksy machinations of the story as grounded as possible.But unlike Burton, Moorhouse knows when to pull in the reins. Her story is by no means ""Edward Scissorhands,"" though she tells it as if it were. ""The Dressmaker"" is as enamored with its endearing strangeness as it is with its characters and their history. Gorgeous shots of sunset over the Outback are given as much care and focus as the dresses Tilly crafts for the townspeople.The story itself, though, tends to divert its focus from where we want it most to be. The more fun townsfolk drop out of the story around the sagging middle of the film, and there's a sizable portion thereabouts where ""The Dressmaker"" suddenly doesn't have anything to do with Winslet's making dresses.But it's nothing Moorhouse doesn't try to overcome by indulging in her bizarre characters and screenplay. This isn't a bad thing at all, especially if, like me, you feel as if Hugo Weaving gets far too many serious roles and needs a good scene or two where he orgasmically heaves over fine fabric."
" lovely
",2017-09-22 00:00:00,10,"The best movie I've seen for a long time. It's funny, quirky and serious and intriguing at the same time. It took a while to get used to the character caricatures, but it works very well, and is in fact refreshing. I thought it might be based on a play, also because of the setting and the costumes, but it's based on the book The Dressmaker.The cast is great. I love Kate Winslet, and her character suits her like Tilly's dresses. Molly and the police officer are absolutely great as well. The town itself is like a mirage in the desert, and there is nowhere but in Australia this story would work. Like a micro cosmos of our strange human nature. Beautifully done!!"
" Possibly one of the best movies of all time
",2017-09-11 00:00:00,10,"Warning - Potential SpoilersIf you haven't yet seen this gem of a film because its flown so far under the radar, you should consider that initially The Shawshank Redemption did exactly the same â€“ that is until audiences discovered it and placed it firmly in most everyone's top ten best films of all time.The Dressmaker is something true movie lovers should definitely consider (I defy you not to love it so much you rush out to buy it on Blu-ray immediately afterwards) but it does come with a warning. If like me you love a good drama with a serious emotional roller- coaster built in â€“ you will need both a stiff drink and a box of tissues close by. Set in the 1950's the film centers around a dressmaker (Winslet) who returns from a successful career in Fashion Central Europe to her Australian outback home to face her past. Accused of murdering one of her classmates at the tender young age of 10 years old, she has no real memory of the event and is determined to discover the truth behind his death in order to clear her name. The premise may not be an original one but don't let that fool you. What unfolds beyond this point becomes one of the most gripping dramas I have seen in an age. Her hometown is perhaps so far away from reality it could be set in the 1900's let alone the 1950's and what becomes very clear from the outset is the underlying currents of hatred, prejudice and sheer malevolence that have poisoned the townsfolk. As the lies and secrets start to unravel, the shock starts to set in both on screen and with the audience as the only true innocent character in the town is killed. It is at this point the story turns a corner and there is absolutely no going back as more characters succumb to their fates. This film grips its audience with every emotion felt on screen, fear, hatred, love, sadness, with genuinely powerful performances from Winslet, Davis and (surprisingly) Hemsworth. If until now you have considered this young actor to be simply eye candy, The Dressmaker will most definitely change your mind.This journey will leave you bereft of every emotion but convinced you have just witnessed possibly one of the best movies of all time."
" Save Yourself-- don't be reeled in!
",2017-08-22 00:00:00,1,"If there are light spoilers in this review, count it as a blessing, perhaps they will save you from watching this (**shudder**) film. The audience is introduced at the beginning (with inappropriately creepy music) to a supposed murder of a young boy committed by a young girl, Tilly (the dressmaker). Tilly is then, heartlessly sent away and becomes an incredible fashion designer, ooh la la. (Side note: the costumes ARE fantastic, but if that is all that draws you, mute this film). The Director must have had her fingers-crossed the audience accepts the notion that young Tilly was capable of murder, as both believable and interesting. Unfortunately it is painfully obvious it couldn't have been anything but an accident, largely due to the comedic tone of the film. The experience is similar to a fish being offered a plain, bait-less hook to bite and be reeled in on. The hinted darkness is eye-roll worthy. ""The Dressmaker"" is silly, silly, silly. Silly you say? But like, fairy-tale-esque? No. Is it whimsical?? If on a 1950's small-town-eccentricities end, then sure. This is well-executed by Judy Davis (the Dressmaker's ""mad"" mother, Molly) and Gyton Grantley (the Dressmaker's love-interest's mentally-handicapped brother, Barney). Those actors seemed to grasp the comedic tone the Director desired for the story. BUT ALAS! all their charm is marred by Winslet and Hemsworth's seriousness-- more fit for a drama. Their romance, BTW, is so inexplicable and poorly established that their tender words and emotions are laughably (and uncomfortably) devoid of understandable substance. Seriously speaking, the mother, Molly was more fit as a love-interest for Teddy than Tilly. But of course, the viewer was supposed to tick ""The Two Most Physically Attractive Actors SHOULD End Up Together"" box on their Film Trope List. As long as this box was checked, then the rough dirty boy Teddy and the fashionable damsel Tilly may be understood as deserving all the depth of love, emotional-intelligence and devotion previously established by love's literary superheroes, Mr. Darcy and Miss Eliza Bennett. There were about 3 different times the film could have ended and put us and the characters out of misery, but instead the yarn got away from the weaver of this story and it became more and more ludicrous. Let this be read with emphasis: NOT in an enjoyable B-Movie way. It is safe to say, Tilly should not have returned home and spared us this story. Do not bother watching."
" Two hours I'll never get back
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,1,"What is it with Australian storytellers? If anyone overcomes a challenge, or has fun, or achieves success, they have to pay -- usually through the loss of their home or a loved one. It's not entertaining, it's not making a statement. It's just a confused, chaotic mish-mash of comedy, satire, thriller, feel-good and tragedy. Like, it's not really a story unless you kill someone off. Immature, clichÃ©'d and boring. When you make up your mind what you're trying to say, gimme a call."
" exaggerating ugly
",2017-07-22 00:00:00,5,"I want to watch a movie with logical epitases, and obviously, this movie goes so far. Over exaggeration and black humor, it is impractical, makes no sense to me, difficult for audiences to put themselves into character's shoes. All I can see are only lacking logic, pathological characters, and exaggerated crimes and vanities. I believe everything should happen for a reason, I can't see a good purpose from this work. No idea why would someone making such a fuss about an imaginary illness. Maximumly zoom and disclose the dark side of humanity? However according to statistics, and the law of averages, I believe good and bad are equal, mostly good take more advantage because many people like to act well. So the movie is isolated from the reality.Besides, who gives the dressmaker the right to judge and punish people? Who she thinks she is? An escaped criminal arsonist, no wonder she has troubled records.Lastly, stay away from someone you don't like, there is no need to go back to them."
" Boring as Heck. Tried it. Failed to Finish.
",2017-07-21 00:00:00,3,"I'm saying ""3"" because Kate Winslet is always excellent. I like to watch her on the screen just to watch HER. For the first 30-40 minutes, I WAS intrigued and wanted to see what was going to happen. Well, I found out what happens: NOTHING.This is one of the worst directed things I have ever seen. And that is saying a LOT. I'm the one who doesn't give up, stealthily soldiering on when the faint-hearted give up! Hey, I made it to the end of Birdman!!I might... MIGHT... watch the last 10 minutes at some juncture so I can see if anything really does happen. Then again, I might stick a red hot poker up my nose.That is all."
" Fantastic!!
",2017-07-14 00:00:00,10,"What a surprise, a total gem of a tale. Not at all what I expected, but I am glad I took a peek, and stayed for the show.Lots of drama one minute, laughing out loud the next, and it never stopped.A young dress designer comes home to find out what happened when she was a child of 10 and sent away from her Mother right after the death of a classmate, and to reunite with her Mother. Sounds simple enough, right? Far from it though.Fantastic cast of amazing characters. I can't say enough good things about this film. But I will say if you don't watch, you are missing a real treat."
" Living well should be the best revenge...
",2017-06-14 00:00:00,7,"...but in the case of Tilly Dunnage (Kate Winslet) a few things need to be straightened out.Thus, the stunning Tilly returns to her home in Dungatar, Australia, back to her alcoholic mother (Judy Davis) who acts like she doesn't remember her and is thought of as the town slut, and back to a town that considers Tilly herself a murderer. Tilly cleans her mother's house and throws the woman in a tub, and then tries to find out what happened fifteen years ago that caused her to be sent away. It is believed by the town that she killed Stewart Pettyman when they were both children. Why can't she remember it?Now a designer in Paris, Tilly soon attracts a clientele of local women who love her chic designs. She also attracts Teddy McSwiney (Liam Hemsworth), the town hunk.Slowly, Tilly finds out the town's secrets, which include a cross- dressing sheriff (Hugo Weaving). He's the least of it.This is a story of redemption and revenge, deliciously told by director Jocelyn Moorhouse and her dynamite cast. Everyone, including the town's old biddies, are wonderful. Sarah Snook, as the impossibly homely Trudy, gets one of the all-time makeovers and is a sight to behold.A few cultural references that weren't quite right: The film appears to take place in 1950 - Tilly, Teddy, and her mother Molly go to see Sunset Boulevard. However, they listen to the soundtrack of South Pacific from 1958 and OKlahoma from 1955. So when the film takes place is anybody's guess - I didn't read the book.All in all, a mixture of dark comedy and drama that is ultimately satisfying. Tilly proves that revenge is a dish best served cold, even in Australia's hot climate."

",2017-05-20 00:00:00,8,"Totally different type movie. Can't even pick a genre. Wonderful! Sad! Funny! If The Good, Bad and Ugly and Pulp Fiction had a love child this might be one of the offspring. Great characters and costumes. I got suspended in make belief and didn't want it to stop. Even when the story turned dark I couldn't turn away."
" Excellent performance by Kate Winslet, Plot needs work
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,6,"Kate's performance was spell binding. The script writers did pretty well up until the last 30 minutes. Then they took a left turn and went off in a direction which to me spoiled the entire movie. Liam Hemsworth was seriously miscast. Imagine a big perfect urbane hunk living in a tiny trailer with a mother that looks like she stepped out of the hobbit and a retarded brother. Truthfully, the script had enough surreal elements to it but the casting of Liam Hemsworth really took it off into another unbelievable dimension. It looked to me as if the scriptwriters had enough for an hour and a half or maybe 3 quarters but the producers wanted 2 hours."
" Not my type of movie, but OK
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,5,"First off, I appreciate any movie these days that can be made for under $20 million without constant action sequences and special effects from one moment to the next. That being said, I wasn't overly impressed. I liked some of the characters, but found their performances more theatrical than realistic. I'm sure it was meant to be that way, but it takes away from the characters in my opinion. I felt the movie spent lots of time pursuing irrelevant tangents and not enough truly developing the dislike we should have for the antagonists. The scenery and music as well as the outfits are enjoyable. Winslet and Hemsworth do a good job acting in this, but it's not enough to save the movie and make this something I would watch more than once."
" I Really Really Wanted to Love This Movie
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,2,"I loved everything about this movie for the first half, then it imploded and punched me in the gut. I was so angry, felt so ripped off that I had to force myself to finish it, in the vain hope something would be salvaged. Like Stephen King movies, the quirky characters romance you until you fall in love with them, then make you watch while they are tortured. If you don't want a sudden shock, something akin to how if would feel if your precious new puppy's head just exploded...stay away. I am going to crawl off now and lick my wounds."
" Confusion
",2017-04-15 00:00:00,3,"I made it 3/4 of the way through the movie before I finally gave up. I spent the whole 90 minutes wondering when I was finally going to start giving a crap. My biggest immediate issue was the range of ages in the casting. I'm all for women above the age of 35 being the lead in a movie, but not at the expense of believability. Kate Winslet was born in 1975, and she was supposed to be in the same age cohort as Liam Hemsworth who was born in 1990. Kate looks great, but she seemed like a cougar in this role.Like every other low reviewer, I had a hard time buying into any of the story lines. There's a murder mystery which is revealed to be a childhood accident (taking away what little tension there was in the movie), there is kind of a question of Winslet's paternity that is brought up when she is called a bastard and her mom a slut when she is younger (but honestly the way it was approached didn't even have me wondering who her father was), there is some curse that Winslet's character is supposed to have that is mentioned every once a while, there is a love story that is cut short in an important lesson to NOT JUMP INTO A SILO BECAUSE YOU MIGHT SUFFOCATE, then there is some dress-making that goes on because that's the title.Maybe the last half hour was redeeming? I don't know if I will ever find out. One star for the amazing outfits, one star for the sassy mother, and according to every Australian that loved this movie I should be giving one star for Winslet's convincing accent. Lack of stars due to poor editing, poor story telling, poor translation, and focus on giving personality to the townies. We get to see a husband rape his wife after he doses her with some sort of hysterical woman tonic, a cross-dressing law enforcer who will drop anything resembling ethics if presented with luxury fabric, and a bunch of other random crap.Apparently this was a book, and it should have stayed that way. Unless you're Australian, then you will probably love this movie for some reason."
" a really terrible movie
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,1,"About the best thing I can say about this movie is that Kate Winslet's makeup always looked good and also her clothes.It seemed to be trying to copy lots of other film makers, trying to be funny (it wasn't) trying to be strange a la Tim Burton, failed miserably. The people, the setting, the behaviors all were just unsettling and depressing.We were watching on Amazon and wanted to check the length of time left. When we saw it was over an hour (and this after a major plot development) we threw in the towel.Few of the characters were likable, fewer admirable, sets, life styles, customs settings all bleak and dreary."
" I so want to give this a better rating
",2017-04-06 00:00:00,7,"So much going right for that movie. Amazing cast, Australian setting that seems genuine, colourful in every facet, gripping story, funny and tragic, utterly weird and still somehow staying within itself.At least 8.5/10 for most of it.{Big spoiler alert}And then they decide to kill off Teddy in the most stupid, implausible and pointless way possible. Trying to impress his girl and in some warped sense prove she's not cursed, by jumping into a silo full of mice. And as it turns out sorghum, which I am pretty sure Teddy would at least consider possible, if he knows it's been loaded that morning. So he drowns. Apparently they have to cut a hole in the side of the silo, which takes 3 hours. No unloading door at the bottom, no way to fish him out from the top? OK, I get it, everyone has to be subjected to a terrible destiny in this movie, and and it needs to be Different. Does a great job of that, too. Still, I didn't recover from that scene, the rest of the movie, which is basically a destructive spiral into death and oblivion, passed in a blur."
" An Oscar Worthy Performance
",2017-04-05 00:00:00,8,"Kate Winslet (Tilly Dunnage) gives an Oscar worthy performance in this fascinating tale about a dressmaker who returns to her barren hometown ostensibly to look after her ailing mother. Judy Davis and Liam Hemsworth also give commendable performances, adding worth to an already rich story line; Davis (Molly Dunnage) as the old, sick mother who can still teach her professional dressmaker how to sew and Hemsworth (Teddy McSwiney) the handsome athlete who schools the beautiful seamstress on the importance of a rugby game to her ""pile of nothing"" hometown. Give full credit to the actors, especially Ms. Winslet, but the backbone of this movie is the novel written by Rosalie Ham. A solid 8 out of 10."
" Couture can be deadly!
",2017-04-03 00:00:00,9,"Fantastique! The cast, the costumes, the story all of it was impeccable. From the opening line, ""I'm back you bastards!"" I was all in for this movie and it did not disappoint. Intrigue and mischief abound in this tale of revenge and maybe even love. Kate Winslet and Liam Hemsworth have the perfect amount of chemistry and charm. The tale does take some twists and turns, one in particular that had me shouting, ""NO!"" with about 30 minutes of movie left. At that point I was concerned with where the plot was going, but they righted the ship in the end and gave the viewers a satisfying ending. The entire film is quite charming and funny. I also enjoyed the slight homage to Priscilla Queen of the Desert with the opening shot of a bus traveling through the desert and then Hugo Weaving's character with a penchant for frilly hats and smooth fabrics - genius!"
" Great (until it was TOO sad)
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,6,"I loved the beauty of this movie: the camera-work, setting, fashion, characterizations and caricatures, and I was blissfully thinking it had come to a very satisfactory conclusion... UNTIL they continued for another half hour and ruined it all. It was sort of like evil triumphing over evil. I felt sort of like when I was watching Downton Abbey and they killed off Matthew and piled heartache after heartache on Lady Edith. The Dressmaker was great - until it wasn't. I don't watch TV to become depressed."
" Brilliant costume dramedy in a great setting with a thoroughly wonderful cast.
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,10,"Excellent movie. Captures the essence of a small town with no redeeming characters.The move has a a great cast, from it's main characters on down to the neighboring town's drama club.Hugo Weaving does tend to steal any scene he is in, but all is forgiven since he is stunningly outfitted in his suit of lights in his last scene."
" A study in closed communities
",2017-03-14 00:00:00,10,"I found this drama uncomfortably scary as we are kept very conscious about the small and closed community portrayed in this movie. It reminded me of 'Far and Away' where families were given land for free but they had to race furiously for it and not all were fair. Here, the people were living in a minute community cut off from bigger ones and jealousy, secrets, adultery, wife battering, vocal harassment and bullying amongst children were accepted as the norm. The one person who got away is the most sane one and we follow her fight to get to the bottom of her story as if she was our own off-spring. The accident at the granary silo is heart-wrenching for anyone, and it takes your breathe away! The bereft mother is very convincing. The ending is wicked but it reminds you that she went back for revenge..."
" Where is my whimsical romance comedy?
",2017-03-07 00:00:00,6,"I've wanted to watch this movie ever since I saw the trailer months back. I waited for it to come to my city, never did. After watching it on Amazon video, I'm glad I didn't go through the trouble of paying 20 dollars for watching it. This movie is just a whole lot of ""What.... why? Wtf?...."" ""Uhhhhhh...."" I had hoped there was some higher meaning for the events that occurred, that there was a great underlying plot to it all, and maybe, just maybe there is a light at the end of the tunnel, but, there isn't. The plot and ""moral conflict"" is so weak it can be barely called that. I like quirky movies, and no, a movie doesn't have to make sense for it to be enjoyed. But this movie has these events that seem random just for the purpose of being random. There is no higher meaning, no greater mystery, nothing at all. It would have been better if Tilly had never come back. A catwalk of beautiful designs would have been more enjoyable. (the dresses are the only reason it even got a 6) Where was the romance? There were more scenes of the old lady with Liam than anyone else. And what the heck was the point of him dying? To tell us she really is cursed? Okay. I don't feel sad for him, more of ""that's kinda random"" moment. The audience had not yet given the time or right amount of charm to fall in love with him before killing him. It did not cause grief, but just another ""wtf moment"". What was his role anyway? All he did was smile and take his shirt off. Am I suppose to fall in love with that? :/ I am sad you think I am that easy to please. Shame on you."
" Hotel Budapest Downunder?
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,8,"I had to stop half-through the movie to check here on IMDb - I just KNEW the director had to be Wes Anderson and was surprised it was not. It's got strikingly similar flavors, a disjointed reality, the ""setting"" views through the cameras and perspectives, the near-absurd characteristics and surrealism, with yes, an underlying set of personal stories often bizarre. I reckon the Australian ethos contributes immensely to the movie's quirkiness, at least as viewed from Texas. As I pay more attention to many of the scenes' visual framings, it is obvious how much genius there is in the director's eye. Many scenes could be images in a modern art gallery. Just when I think I've seen it all, SHE takes it another step further into a kind of insanity, a most enjoyable lunacy. ""No rubbish heah""."
" Daft and surprisingly dark
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,8,"This surprising and over-the-top comedy-drama offers the likes of Kate Winslet, Judy Davis and Hugo Weaving the chance to overact with impunity so it's nice to see them keep their performances in check while it gives the youngest of the Hemsworth brothers (Liam) the opportunity to show off his eye-candy status while keeping his acting skills under wraps. It's both daft and darker than you might expect though ultimately it's Davis, as always, who lends it a touch of class. If director Jocelyn Moorhouse though she was making some kind of feminist statement she was very much mistaken; this is basically a period fantasy in fancy clothes, beautifully photographed by Donald McAlpine with a decent enough story that is just weird enough to make the whole thing interesting. For some reason it didn't take off with either the critics or the public but I have a feeling it could be heading for cult status within the next few years. Seek it out."
" Wonderful Aussie film
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,8,"The Dressmaker is a delightful Australian movie set in the imaginary town of Dungadar, in rural Victoria, in the 1950s. Tilly, the prodigal daughter of Molly, returns home in full glamour and as high-fashion seamstress, ready to attend to her elderly mother.This is a modern classic mix of comedy and drama, with a phenomenal cast ensemble,great characters, an awesome atmosphere, and a fair dinkum just ending. The movie has very witty moments, some unforgettable scenes, interesting archetypal small-town characters, and great performances overall.This is an chorus film, and everybody is good in it, even Liam Hemsworth, whose talent is wasted in Hollywood mediocre films, is good here. However, Hugo Weaving, Judy Davis, Shane Bourne, and the British Winslet are really excellent and show how versatile and talented actors they are. Despite the age difference, Winslet & Hemsworth make a great couple and have great chemistry on camera!The production is top-notch: Awesome dresses, gorgeous make-up, wonderful rural atmosphere, artistic lighting and cinematography, and a very lovely Spanish flair in the background music. The Dressmaker is a film both about revenge and wanting to fit, about how the hardships of life can take us to better and higher places in life. It is also about the effects of bullying on children and how they pervade adulthood and can brand people for life and make their social relationships a nightmare. Finally, it is also a movie about small group dynamics, how some small groups would never accept anybody different, would punish anybody that seem not to fit, and would never open the door to anybody who belongs to the group but is an individual, unless they can use the same person for their own benefit; if you have grown within a small community, rural or not, you will recognize many group attitudes, behaviors and human characters reflected on those portrayed in the film. That was, at least, my case. The main downside of the film to me is that the story wanders unnecessarily, that the different themes aren't always organically blended, and some of the characters aren't fully understood. For example, we don't know the real background of the McSweneys, or why the schoolteacher hates Tilly so much. Also, I would have loved a bit of more background on Tilly's wanderings through Europe and what exactly takes her to her hometown. The same can be said about Molly, I wanted to know what happens to her from being fully vilified to, apparently, fully accepted or at least not molested.The fact that the movie isn't pretentious and doesn't take itself too seriously adds another layer of charm to a film that is really funny, thoughtful and a great example of what Aussies can do when they take film-making in their own country seriously.Very enjoyable!"
" glamour comes to the Outback
",2017-01-31 00:00:00,10,"With revenge depicted violently in Quentin Tarantino's movies, it's an interesting change to see it depicted subtly in ""The Dressmaker"". Kate Winslet plays a fashion maven who returns to her hometown in rural Australia to take care of her mentally unstable mother. But she also seeks to get even with those who wronged her years earlier.Winslet's character is the embodiment of 1950s high society, and so naturally when she returns to this podunk town they basically view her as a prostitute.* But it turns out that plenty of the townspeople have their own little secrets (namely the sergeant). The best part is the trick that Winslet's character plays on everyone towards the end of the movie. Judy Davis, as Winslet's character's mother, is actually the most interesting character in the whole movie. I got the feeling that the events of previous years had damaged her.I had never heard of Jocelyn Moorhouse before watching this movie. It turns out that she had directed some movies. Having seen ""The Dressmaker"", I'd like to see her previous movies, and I hope that she continues making these sorts of movies.*If ""trollopes"" look like that, then bring 'em on!"
" Quirky, funny and surprisingly sad
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,9,"I somehow missed this movie until I came across it only very recently. From what I read about it, I expected a drama, something a little melancholic and maybe a little vengeful. Whilst it is all those things, it is also wonderfully quirky and fun - the humour unsurprisingly reminded me a lot of Strictly Ballroom. And yet, it is really rather touching and sad as well at times surprisingly earthy and even somewhat violent - I would not recommend this movie for children by the way. Whilst Kate Winslet is without a doubt an excellent actress and delivers her performance with great heart and humour, it is Judy Davis who absolutely delivers a stand-out performance here. Coupled with Liam Hemsworth' portrayal of the perfect and loving guy next door, this movie is an absolute gem!"
" a classy remake of Alfred Hitchcock's SUSPICION
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,9,"The famous 1941 movie on which it is based seems to point to Cary Grant as the serial killer without of course being recognized or apprehended in the purposely enigmatic ending. This remake is set in rural Australia around 1950. Kate Winslet and Judy Davis step out of character as the leads to shine in brilliant performances.Rural Australia as filmed has a grit and grime intended by the author which of course is never the focus of a Hitchcock movie. The premise is Kate Winslet is seen as the victim in a series of magnificently shot and edited tales each one a delight. The crazy quilt of sequences is the only reason I give it a 9 despite of course enjoying every moment. One shot is soft porn, another bully hazing, another comic relief and another further trying to make the audience guess who is the murderer"
" A real Australian film
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,8,"There's nothing quite like Australian films. Though they're all quite different there is a certain type of film, with quirky surreal elements and an easy mix of comedy and tragedy that always seems distinctly Australian to me. The Dressmaker fits within that category. The film focuses on Tilly, (Kate Winslet, sounding to my ear like a true Australian, but I'm sure those who know better will correct me if I'm wrong), returning to Dungatar, the place of her birth, in order to tend to her sick, alcoholic mother Molly (Judy Davis). The last time Tilly was in town she was ten years old, considered the joke of the town because her mother was unwed at the time she had her and her parentage was unknown, and was being escorted away because she had been accused of murdering Stewart Pettyman, the beloved son of the sinister councillor Pettyman. Many years have passed since then and Tilly is now an accomplished seamstress and designer, looking to gain answers into whether she really killed Stewart or nor (she blocked the traumatic incident from her memory).The thing to understand about the film is that it's really a comedy-tragedy western, only instead of a shotgun our heroine wields a sewing machine, using her creations to aid or sabotage as the case may be. Winslet and Davis are great here as a mother daughter pairing. Liam Hemsworth shows up as Tilly's dreamy childhood playmate who is more interested in her than ever now that they're both adults. The real star of course is the fashion which is absolutely spectacular. Just tons of beautiful outfits and Winslet has a dream body for those gorgeous 50s silhouettes which celebrate her hourglass figure. A wonderful return to form after a long absence from directing by Jocelyn Moorhouse. I can only hope that it isn't too long before she's back in the director's chair."
" Disappointing (very mild spoilers, I won't ruin anything though)
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,7,"I was overall disappointed when I finally saw the film. I read the book ahead of time, which was much better, and that probably heightened my expectations of the film.To keep this brief, the 3 strongest parts were Kate Winslet's acting ability, the costumes, and the set design. The 3 weakest parts were the casting, the pace, and the acting of everyone else. GOOD1. Kate Winslet's acting: as always, Winslet was brilliant. She conveyed every emotion perfectly, and completely stole the film. 2. The costumes: this was massively important, as it is a central plot point. The dresses were spectacular, and they did a good job of making Una Stubbs' dresses ugly too.3. Set design: they perfectly captured Tilly's little cottage, the smudgy town, and the desolate landscapes. It was visually stunning, and I love the lavender on the porch. BAD1. The casting: this was the biggest problem for me. While Kate was phenomenal, no amount of good acting made me overlook the blatant age gap between her and her co-stars. Tilly is supposed to be a YOUNG girl- not 40. She was 15 years older than her love interest, Liam Hemsworth. Sarah Snook who played Gertrude Pratt, a girl supposed to be her age too, was about 12 years younger than her. It made it worse that they tried to act like they were all the same age, because they were clearly so far from it. It was distracting and off-putting. They either should have cast elder costars for Winslet or a younger actress to play Tilly Dunnage. Imagine Idris Elba playing a KKK leader- he could act perfectly, but his looks would make it hard for the audience to believe it entirely. Her body was also an issue. While she is a knockout, and has aged incredibly well, no one can pretend that she looks 25- or that her figure does. The idea that men would literally be stumbling and tripping over themselves because of her appearance at the rugby game was just not feasible. 2. The pace: the pace was choppy and unprofessional. The first half was pure comedy, and the second half all of a sudden became drama. They tried to include many plot points from the book, which made it feel more rushed and forced important details to be hastily shoved together. One part that they really shouldn't have rushed was the process of Teddy courting Tilly. In the book it took quite a while, where the movie version had Tilly going out with Teddy almost instantly. It took away from the suffering she had supposedly gone through in her past when she so quickly fell in love again. 3. The acting: I don't know if perhaps Australian films just have a different style, but as a Canadian watching, the entire thing felt overacted by the supporting cast. The attempted humour completely fell flat because no one knew the meaning of subtlety. I've seen descriptions calling it a ""black comedy"" and let me straighten that out right now-it is not at all. Judy Davis has gotten a lot of chatter on her role, and I will agree that her emotional parts were acted superbly. The ""funny"" parts, less so. However, I know what caliber of actress she is, as well as Caroline Goodall, which leads me to conclude that the fault lay with poor direction- not lack of talent. Overall, I was just waiting for it to end. If you are to watch it, perhaps you will not agree with my review, but I wanted to post it for reference regardless."
