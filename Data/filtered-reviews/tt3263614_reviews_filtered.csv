" Beautiful, Dark & Sad
",2021-03-15 00:00:00,9,"I recently watched season 4 of the TV series Fargo. About half way through I looked to see if anyone had made a map of where all the events from the film and series had taken place. Of course they had. I looked around the map and noticed something on it called Kumiko The Treasure Hunter. Curious, I searched a bit and found a trailer. It looked good, fun and quirky. I decided that I was going to watch the rest of the Fargoverse in chronological order (season 4, 2, the film, 1 and 3) and that it would be fun to end with Kumiko The Treasure Hunter. Boy was I wrong. Not that Kumiko isn't a great film! It really is. But it was not at all fun and quirky. It was a terrifyingly sad tale about unchecked mental illness and people not being able to (or in the case of her family and coworkers - not wanting to - ) read those signs and help.
Possible spoilers ahead:
The first half of the film takes place in Tokyo and shows the world that Kumiko lives in and is mentally retreating from. Her awful workplace environment, bad relationship with her mother and her research into the box of money (her treasure) that is buried in the film Fargo.
At the midway point when she arrives in Minnesota there is a beautiful scene of an airplane deicing that is set to the song ""Dreams"" by Peter Drake. It feels like this is the point where the film might shift gears and Kumiko might come out of her darkness with the help of her new adventure. Nope. She just falls deeper and deeper into her mental illness. A few people try to help her along her journey without really realizing how much help she actually needs. They give her rides or hot cocoa and buy her a proper jacket but then they let her wander off alone on her quest.
Anyway, I am not sure how to end this review. I think this film will be sitting with me for a long time to come. If you are looking for something set in the same world as Fargo this is not it. But that doesn't mean it is not worth your time. Definitely worth a watch just don't let the trailer fool you."
" This is (not really) a true story
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,9,"I watched this cold without looking at the reviews and it stuck with me for long time after i watched it, which is the magic of powerful and simple story telling and authentic acting. Whilst this is a wholly fictitious premise around the tragic death of Takako Konishi, it captured my imagination. I wasn't the only person who believed the original fargo was a true story. Why? Because we were told it is.This film is starkly in contrast to the fargo film and subsequent tv series. There aren't any quirky, interesting characters. No cautionary messages around good and bad deeds. No build up to showdowns, shootouts and powerful conclusions. It's a quiet film, and I struggle to remember when I felt such sorrow and discomfort than when I saw the lead part with her only friend in her lonely life.The true story of takako is even more banal, pitiful and desolate. I won't discuss it here as I think finding out about her prior to, or after, watching the film is part of the process of watching this. Needless to say she was simply a woman who was searching for comfort and kindness, and for whatever reason, believed she could find it in fargo.Films like this are rare and should receive more attention."
" A headlong trip into mental instability
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,2,"Sorry. I did not see all the depth many on here took away from this film. All I saw was a lost soul, settling severe depression and attempting to fulfill a fantasy of long distant discovery of lost treasure. It did not have any of the magical realism of the Mexican Masters, nor any of the imagination of the great Japanese directors. This movie was a total indulgence."
" A well told tale
",2020-09-16 00:00:00,8,"The Japanese seem to have an extraordinary talent for storytelling. This film is no exception to the rule. The writers take you from one emotion to another at the blink of an eye.
This is a story of hope, adventure and conviction. The lead character is frustrating to watch at times but you can't help routing for her. The people she meets on her journey are very interesting and well portrayed. It's a charming tale with no nasties and it leaves it's audience with a warm feeling.
I loved it!"
" ""Solitude? It's just fancy loneliness.""
",2020-08-02 00:00:00,8,"Kumiko is depressed and isolated in busy Tokyo, but latches on to the idea of going on an adventure to find treasure as an escape from a world in which she can't find meaning, joy, or connection. Something I found myself asking throughout this film is how well Kumiko recognises that her treasure hunt is futile. This is ultimately a drama film where we follow Kumiko as she spirals until the film's bittersweet ending. This film is shot beautifully, especially with its use of colour. There is a lot of silence throughout the film, which means the viewer will need to feel settled to watch it. It's certainly left me interested in seeing more of what the creators have to offer. Kumiko the Treasure Hunter is wonderful, if sad; unusual, but enchanting."
" Interesting character study
",2020-06-24 00:00:00,7,"Most reviewers seem to prefer the second half of the movie over the first. In it, we see Kumiko in the United States and her isolation and inability to properly understand others doesn't seem quite certain. Does Kumiko really not understand much English? Or are we only supposed to believe it?Right after she lands, she is approached by a religious group. As soon as she knows that those guys aren't going to help her to reach her one goal (to get to Fargo and find her treasure), she leaves. The same thing happens with other people she meets. She is focused and driven by her wish to find the treasure and one might wonder if the treasure isn't more of a metaphor for something else.I for one actually liked the first half. I spent a few months in Tokyo and although it is a great city with friendly people, I couldn't help but feel a certain isolation and loneliness, even though I was living with my girlfriend at the time. I can somewhat imagine what it must be like for Kumiko to live there. The Japanese society is a harsh and demanding one. Everyone has their place and function. This can come in handy, as people don't require to be very responsible or make a lot of tough choices, society or work will do that for you.But for an illness such as depression, living in Tokyo or a similar city is hell. Society will consider you as lazy or a failure and for yourself, it will be soulcrushing and tiresome to go through all the motions and fake niceties that exist. From what I've seen, Japanese can be quite harsh with other people, although they carry a smile.For someone like Kumiko, this might explain why she comes off as selfish by some reviewers. In Japan, she has little choice (and what little freedom or choice she does get, like not accepting her friends number or bailing on her or disposing of some tuxedos) and people judge her (at the office, her mom) or pity her at best (at the library).In the US, she has no cultural restrictions. She can be ""selfish"" and pursue what she actually wants. Back in Japan, no one can understand that.So to me, this pursuit of a treasure is much more a pursuit of being an individual, someone who may not fit into the expectations of others. And is it any wonder that the few creatures who really get to her are unselfish, sincere beings, such as her bunny or the policeman, who seemingly have no expectations and just let her be Kumiko?"
" waste of time
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,1,"Spend your 105 minutes doing anything would be better than watching this movie.Horrible, selfish, mean protagonist just ruins what could have been an interesting movie."
" A well done ambiguous movie
",2019-04-29 00:00:00,7,"The interpretations people have of this film are very divided. Some seems to think its a comedy, where you enter in Kumiko cute escapist fantasy. Others seem to believe its the very sad story of a mental breakdown. Critics who believe the former seem to view the film as great, while the one who believe the later are more critical. I tend to agree with both. An actual mental breakdown will be seen as such by the people who tries to help the ill person, aka Kumiko. However, from the point of view of the afflicted, the nice people who tries to help them are just parasites who try to destroy their beautiful fantasy. Therefore, I think the film can be viewed as either beautiful or sad depending on who the viewer choose to associate with. If I am correct, this film is very well written and an nuanced portrayal of mental illness.
I may be wrong, though!Anyway, Kumiko the treasure hunter may be well written, its well acted and beautifully shot. As its often the case with american indie film, it is also interesting... but not that much enjoyable. I'm glad I saw it, though."
" The Zellner Brothers?
",2019-02-13 00:00:00,10,"Who are these people, but more importantly where have they been all my life? These are special people, and these type of creative minds need a lot of love a lot of support and much more love.I just watched the trilogy, firstly 'Kid-Thing' which was masterly, I thought they could not top it , but when they took something as gross and hackneyed and wasted as the Western genre and made 'Damsel' I was like wooooo, who or what fun place did these people come out of cause that's where I want to be 24/7!But then I closed it out with this gem, I would have to say from a standpoint of just art for the sake of art, whatever that means, I guess, an original idea, then I suppose how the story unfolds round and round here and now there until the end did it have some style and add a fresh new unique taste to a theme or the context something of this nature - and I would have to say, as agonizing for me! to keep watching this and not scream out of my lungs, no , no, just go back home, go be with mom until you find a nice husband!' hahaha, at the very end I thought she saw the light , I hoped and I was praying for her safe return....I would definitely , as much as I love Kid-thing , 'are you the devil?' haha! that twisted lil' girl was such an amazing character to create! and poor poor Ethel! I will never get Ethel's haunting screams of desperation from out of my head ever!And how fun of a ride Damsel was, going round and round the grossness of the Western times!But definitely , I would have to say this surmounts this for it was glorious! Fargo and Shogun , what more could you ask? In all, I just haven't seen something so creative and yet simple and fun in such a long time, I mean truly ask yourselves one question when you want to diss this film, who the hell on gods' green earth would of thought of 'Fargo' and ""Buscemi's treasure"" as an entire plot of a story? Who in their right mind, no one, that's because whomever created this was not right, they were fun creative people! Who were born to entertain us so just relax, and try to have a bit of fun , these movies are supposed to make us ask why all the other films don't try to at least be a bit more entertaining by trying out some fun new quirky things, Cheese!"
" a Japanese take on Nebraska?
",2018-12-15 00:00:00,7,"Oh wait, did this come out before Nebraska? Anyways, a comedy that doesn't let you laugh. It's well done, half-open-endedness is nice. Some characters are a little exaggerated but that matched the style of the movie. Overall, it's a fun watch and definitely worth it."
" Strange film, a real oddball drama with comedy elements
",2018-08-18 00:00:00,6,"It's difficult to describe or explain 'Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter', because there's nothing quite like it. I'm not even sure how you would categorise this film. Officially it's a drama, but it's also a comedy/adventure and one of very few films that's bleak and depressing yet somehow amusing at the same time. It's a unique film that seems to be aimed at a very specific audience, though who that audience is, however, I'm not quite sure.'Kumiko' is a slow and subtle film that centers almost entirely around the title character. The mystery and intrigue surrounding her is probably the only thing that makes this otherwise dull film interesting. In fairness, it does for this reason make for quite fascinating viewing, though the viewer does require a lot of patience and much of the subtle humour requires attention to pick up on. 'Kumiko' is a strange film and certainly on the weirdest comedy dramas I've seen."
" Self-deception with a sublime ending.
",2018-05-13 00:00:00,6,"How can you help someone that is fixated on a delusion?Kumiko, an aging (ie. near 30) office lady in Japan, decides to follow her dream. That dream is that the fictional movie ""Fargo"" is a documentary and she means to find the money that is buried in it.As she journeys, people give her suggestions, all of which would have ended this story happily. As it is, the ending is simultaneously the saddest happy ending and the happiest sad ending of any movie I can recall."
" Requires a lot of post-film reflection
",2017-12-03 00:00:00,7,"Kumiko requires a lot of post-film reflection, as one tries to figure out what the point of it all really was. On the whole, it seems to be a story about a confused, naive and depressed young woman on the search for a better life, or at least something different.The slow opening of the film set in Tokyo does run on a little long, but once Kumiko arrives in America, we're treated to a lovely host of well-rounded characters that our titular character meets along her harsh journey through the freezing roads of Minnesota, beautiful imagery and an alluring performance from Kikuchi, not to mention the film's spot-on, deadpan comic timing."
" A sufferable waste of a good story
",2017-03-10 00:00:00,3,"Dream doesn't cost a thing, people say. It doesn't. But to make into a reality is a whole different story and there's always delusions on the way. In ""Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter"" Rinko Kikuchi plays the title role, a young Japanese woman whose source of happiness is to find buried ""treasures"" in places. One day, she finds a VHS copy of Coen brothers classic ""Fargo"" and becomes obsessed by one particular part of the film which revolves around Steve Buscemi's character hiding a bag filled with money, burying it in the snow. Kumiko doesn't have much going on with her life: can't stand her colleagues from work, barely connects herself with an old friend, and there's pressure from her boss and more pressure from her mom living somewhere and always putting her daughter down for leaving her behind. With that mind frame, our ""hero"" is about to go on a journey to the States to find ""Fargo treasure"". Why? Because she thinks it's real. Like ""Fargo"", this film puzzles its viewers in trying to find ways to establish what can be deemed real and what it's not. The Coen's film begins with a disclaimer about the events portrayed as a real story. I watched it as a kid and totally believed, and they weren't the only source for that information. Many people jumped on that bandwagon without doing a bit of research. It'd take me a few more years to find out nothing like that happened and that the directors were doing a prank on viewers. It's effect was a masterful and successful one. Now, comes the opposite side: ""Kumiko"" was indeed based on a real story, the story of Takako Konishi, a woman from Japan found dead in a field in Minnesota and the report on the news was that she was looking for that bag of cash from ""Fargo"". But the Zellner brothers didn't make a thrilling project with all those great elements. It's the most annoying film I've seen in ages, sad, bleak, with poor use of symbolism and a picture that don't make a good service, whether being entertaining or cheating a whole section of the crowd with its final image. A gorgeous and meaningful cinematography couldn't make for the film's errors and loads of absurdity. I just couldn't care for any the characters (except the state trooper, he was well-intentioned but too bad he wasn't a cinephile like I am. I'd be more helpful in that situation he faced); Kumiko was one of those characters that you understand while she's facing objections and problems in life, she's very depressed but doesn't know exactly, acting in a child-like manner and she can only get a sense of pure joy when she's watching ""Fargo"" repeatedly to the point of destroying the tape. Most of her actions make the story go further and further from enjoyment and greatness. Ripping a page from a book when she could've asked for a photocopy; her actions with her old acquaintance, someone who truly likes her; and when told about that the film is not real (""No fake!""). Those moments had me cringing so bad, I couldn't wait for its ending. Nothing wrong with Kikuchi's performance but it's a minor effort that wasn't worthy of her talents and in some bits I was reminded of her role in ""Babel"", and that made her seem as an one note actress.A cultural thing or coincidence? I'm not sure. But I was reminded of another Japanase individual - a more famous and also real one - who was stubborn with his actions and it also revolved on him being stuck in the wilderness to follow his ultimate convictions. His name was Hiroo Onoda, the last WWII soldier to surrender in 1974 (that's right, 29 years after the end of the conflict). He stood there on this island in Philippines, refusing to accept the war was over because he needed his superior officer word on that. He and three other soldiers stuck on this place receiving leaflets and other messages about the fact (one gave it up in 1950, two others were shot through the years). And I like to think he was the lucky one unlike Kumiko, which makes me wonder what would be fundamental in Kumiko or Konishi in stopping their pointless search? Possibly the presence of Joel or Ethan Coen - if they ever heard of them. If the makers took the real premise of someone trying to find the impossible after seeing a movie, turn into a comedy with a bunch of friends trying to find this money (my idea goes like this: a megalomaniac film buff joins his two slow-minded friends to a search around the globe) then we'd have something far more relevant than this thing. The Zellner's weren't aiming at anything specifically. What was the point? To show that the escapism brought on by the movies can actually move mountains yet they'll never be real except in one's head? The right movie must fall into the right hands and minds? Obsessed people need to be better controlled, even the ones who look more innocently? I got nothing from here except some beautiful landscape and the daring move of making the majority of the film in Japanese with captions instead of going with English in everything. High hopes for this movie but the final result was a total crash. They had the intriguing real-life story to follow (the reasoning behind the woman's obsession was right after some relationship issue, and the writers should have follow that story) yet they messed it up. Unworthy of the praise it got in several places. 3/10"
" How sad-(Spoilers ahead)
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,8,"I first discovered this film when I was looking at the bio of an actress called Ryoko Fujino from ""Solomon's Perjury Part 1 and 2, 2015."" On the side panel of recommended films I saw the thumbnail of a pretty Japanese lady in an alluring red hoodie and quilted patchwork. I immediately clicked on it and was pleasantly surprised to see a trailer of Kumiko Treasure Hunter featuring Rinko Kikuchi (from ""Babel"" which has been one of my favorite films for the passed 10 years for its Japanese segment, and I even have a screenshot of a scene within Shinjuku as my desktop photo, haha). I loved the synopsis about a lonely Tokyo woman, in particular (with me being a Japan-phile), and that she was seeking treasure. So I stopped watching vlogs about touring through Osaka which I had been doing for days, and looked online for a copy of this.Well during the film I was confused whether I should constantly be laughing out loud or not. But I see now it's a dark comedy, which I didn't expect. The trailer made it seem like it was a horror. So I was on edge the whole film, though I found it funny. It's also nicely shot though kind of bleak, with its slightly low color saturation and depiction of loneliness. It's an Impressionistic film, one of my fav. types, because it's quite relaxing how films like this silently follow the actor/actress around and have us take in the atmosphere and landscape and vivid sounds rather than cheat us through vapid or verbose dialogue; this film says what it has to without people actually saying much. I think I found this disconcerting film so funny because I related to her seclusive ways, and might be somewhat laughing at myself through Kumiko's weirdness and what these people who encounter her might be thinking of her and therefore me. I still found this film vaguely sad though; Kumiko in that blanket reminds me of a documentary about homeless people in Oakland and there was a small and grimy but loving East Asian woman who had been homeless for decades in the county and ended up dying on the streets, and the film was dedicated to her. **SPOILER** While watching this film I had no idea it was basically a true story, but I still felt this sense of impending doom for Kumiko. Because she's broke, homeless, alone and doesn't speak English. Realistically, that means bad news. Towards the ending when Kumiko is walking in the night in the middle of a snowy forest, I felt increasingly worried for her. I just knew she would die because of another documentary I saw (haha) about a Lakota Native American woman who killed herself by getting drunk and freezing to death on the road in North Dakota, and how it affected her daughter and granddaughter. So while watching I told myself, ""I wonder if the director is going to be merciful and not show Kumiko dead but make a happy ending just for her."" And so he did. It almost induced a massive eye roll for me and then...when they showed her pet rabbit there, I saw it was a fake happy ending. It's probably her in Heaven or something because it's physically impossible for her rabbit to have wound up next to her in the middle of an American tundra when she left him in Japan...and, well, it's only a movie; there is no treasure. So I researched the true story behind the film and the real woman died the same way the Native American woman had died. How sad. So this in a way is like a horror."
" Wanted to like this, but no..
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,5,"This seemed like an interesting movie to watch on mubi, I didn't actually know much of what it is about, but based on the trailer the cinematography and mood seemed to be top notch, and they were, but nothing else really worked for me.Another reviewer wondered what motivates someone to make a movie like this, I was thinking about this too. The movie was slow, so there was a lot of time to think about. So I read this is based on a true story, I must have missed it if it was mentioned in the movie, but this might be one motivation. My initial idea when watching the movie was that they just wanted to be creative and artsy, probably made by people who work on advertising or music videos, but this may as well not be the case.So, the images on screen were stunning, the cinematography is absolutely great. The script is somewhat interesting, although I've never liked it when they reference other real movies within a movie. I don't know why, this just never worked for me, especially when it's such an integral part of the movie. But there are many more problems. Kumiko was left as a mystery. Maybe there were hints why she was the way she was - depressed, anti-social, delusional, autistic? She had a driving ambition to get money, but why? I never understood what was the motivation. Was it a social commentary for expectations towards women in Japanese culture? They surely underlined the work and family aspect, how women are expected to build their lives. Her mom was constantly asking Kumiko about dating etc, I have a hard time believing a mother of an autist or a mentallly ill would do this. She also meets an old friend which suggests that Kumiko wasn't always as she is now, so something must have happened, but what? And what's the connection between this and the quest for money. Why would a depressed woman obsess so much about money, what would she do with it. She also showed emotions towards her pet, but was clearly not big on people skills (even without the language barrier).Kumiko started out and stayed very distant in the movie and it was difficult to understand any of her actions. Maybe if she had been slightly more relatable this would have worked, or if they had opened a bit more of her past, but as it is, it definitely didn't work for me."
