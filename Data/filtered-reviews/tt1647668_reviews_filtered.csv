" A very enjoyable 124 minutes
",2020-11-13 00:00:00,8,"I can't say there is anything overly noteworthy about 'Million Dollar Arm'. but it's well paced and features a great (true) story - it makes for a very enjoyable 124 minutes.Jon Hamm is a good choice to play lead character JB, he does carry the film with his performance. There are other pleasant performances though, Pitobash Tripathy (Amit) stands out most from those behind Hamm. Bill Paxton (Tom), Lake Bell (Brenda), Suraj Sharma (Rinku) and Madhur Mittal (Dinesh) merit props too.It's a feel-good premise, one that is rather nice to see play out. The score is solid, as is the cinematography. It's a positive that they spend a decent chunk of the film actually in India, I had a inkling they might've skipped it but thankfully they do not - they tell the story well. It's probably Disneyfied in ways, but who cares.It isn't anything necessarily special, but I certainly thoroughly enjoyed this. Recommended."
" Not bad but not great either
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,5,It was a nice movie but not sure it sticks completely to the original story or not. The part of the movie has been shot in India but still not able to capture the mood and essence of India and some bad light about India was shown as a fun part in the movie.I am not much of a baseball fan but there are good movies about baseball that has been made and much smarter than this one. This movie clearly is not able to focus on the primary subject the film is referring. Even the story of Rinku and Dinesh is undercooked. There could have been a much engaging story.
" it felt good
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,10,Feel good kind of movie... loved casting and shooting locations.
" The Scout 2?
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,5,Rich rude guy needs money so he finds baseball players in India and risk his career to bring them to America. Meanwhile Lake Bell calls him out for being a rude asshole then he becomes super nice guy and everyone is happy. Moral of the story rich people be nicer.
" good sports movie
",2019-09-20 00:00:00,8,"This was a decent feel good sports movie based on a true story. A struggling sports agent travels to India to check out cricket bowlers in order to convert them into baseball pitchers. The two ""winners"" are taken back to the States and baseball spring training camps. Imevitable culture clashes, misunderstandings, and hilarity ensues.
I loved the scenes in India, the ""tryout"" scenes, and where the scout stumps the guy in India with a basic baseball question.
This is a good family sports movie that will satisfy anyone. I enjoyed it.
*** out of ****"
" Underrated
",2019-07-31 00:00:00,9,I hadn't even heard of this movie before I was channel surfing one night and saw it on TNT and decided to give it a try. I was not at all disappointed. No it didn't get critical acclaim but I found it to be a very compelling story with excellent acting. I don't post often and only do so when I feel that a movie deserves more credit than what it received. If you're a fan of sports or just inspiring stories I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. Give it a chance.
" Feel good movie
",2019-03-30 00:00:00,9,"I am a baseball enthusiast and loved this movie. It felt in the same realm as Slumdog millionaire, but not as dark. Such a feel good movie."
" A rollercoaster
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,7,"Sometime keeps you on the edge of your seat with emotions all over the place wanting the kids to succeed , however the lack of baseball rather than politics is too much of a difference to be higher than a seven."
" one of the best sports movies
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,10,Review: I really liked this movie because it shows you how the sport of baseball has evolved due to players from all over the world. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. The camera crew did an exceptional job using crane and aerial shots to really make us the audience feel like we are in India when all this is happening. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" A LEFTY WITH JUICE
",2018-10-07 00:00:00,8,"JB (Jon Hamm) is a sports agent down on his luck. He thinks of an idea to travel to India to obtain new talent. The aspect of having a billion new fans who want caps and jerseys gathers him a sponsor. Half the film consists of JB traveling through impoverished India holding tryouts of eager kids who can't even spell baseball. He manages to find two kids to bring back and train.The second half continues with his formulaic relationship with his tenet, plus the trials and tribulations of training too foreigners. Alan Arkin plays the old scout in a funny predictable manner. If anything the film was tweak to make it feel like a made for TV movie. A little Bollywood enters the production during the finals. Good American-Indian fusion soundtrack.Parental Guidance: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity."
" Nothing exceptional, but decent family film
",2017-12-26 00:00:00,6,"If you looked up ""family movie"" in the dictionary, this film would be listed there. Nothing exceptional, but enough fun, laughs and story to go around. Great casting and some great moments...even if the script could have been slightly less cliche."
" They made my day !!
",2017-11-03 00:00:00,10,"I think this movie is one of the bests ever! . The small details about the two kids life and there actions first time in America are perfect . Also, I loved JB's feelings and thoughts changing .Brenda was very ideal , I fill in love with her character . After all , the best thing is positive energy that the story gives to you .. it's very cheering :). I would never be bored watch this again , and I hope one day meet Dinesh and Rinku <3 .."
" Yes mister JB sir
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,8,When I saw the credits in the beginning of the movie and I saw it was a Disney movie I feared the worst because that's normally not the kind of movies I like. But since it was based on a true story it makes it a bit different and more enjoyable to watch. And I have to admit it was a good movie. A bit predictable but nonetheless an enjoyable feelgood movie about the two first Indians becoming professional baseball players. Even my wife that hates baseball and most sports in general thought it was a lovely story. You don't need to love baseball to appreciate Million Dollar Arm. The cast did a good job and the filming was very professional. You feel immediately an immense sympathy for the Indian characters. If you like feelgood stories with a happy ending than you should watch this one.
" Nondescript, no other major faults
",2017-03-09 00:00:00,4,"A struggling sports agent is at the end of his rope, which forces him to get creative and try a gamble no one has ever tried before. He figures that he needs a new and upcoming baseball star pronto, but where would one find one. Then he figures that India as a country is a huge untapped market and surely he can travel there, hold auctions and find someone who's able to pitch a mean ball.And from thereon out it's the tried, true and patented Disney sports film formula played to death in front of your eyes. You know exactly how the story is going to go from minute one. Sure, it's not a kid's film per se, so the main character is allowed to be a bit of a jerk and there can be scenes where people are not covered from head to toe in conservative clothing, but it's still squeaky clean and safe. And I have nothing against the Disney formula, but it still means that the film is very much paint by numbers.That being said, the film is based on true events, which gives it a bit more oomph. India as a country is given a fair treatment, the two Indian baseball players given a chance to break into the American leagues are a lot of fun, the main character is likable despite or perhaps because of his jerkiness.Would I recommend the movie to anyone? Perhaps if I knew they were a die-hard baseball fan... Other than that, probably not, I have to admit."
" I Really Wanted To Like This Movie, But...
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,4,"I saw this movie in theaters for two reasons: 1. I'm a huge baseball fan; and 2. I watch Med Men (i.e. the Jon Hamm factor). Even after 20 or so minutes, when I knew exactly what this movie would be, I still really, really wanted to like it. Unfortunately, this one is schmaltzy ""Disney"" through and through.For a basic plot summary, ""Million Dollar Arm"" tells the story of how sports agent J.B. Bernstein (Hamm) starts a competition called Million Dollar Arm in order to find a major league baseball player from the relatively untapped market of India. The two athletes he finds, Rinku (Suraj Sharma) and Dinesh (Madhur Mittal), are in for quite a culture shock as they travel to America for the first time and have to essentially learn baseball from scratch.First of, let me be clear in that I'm not attaching a star-ranking to the overall story here. It is truly a fascinating and inspiring tale for baseball fans and human-interest fans alike.As a movie, though, ""Million Dollar Arm"" falls far short of being great. The main problem? It doesn't have a clear focus, so it tries to do too much and doesn't really nail anything. This could have been a hard-core baseball fan movie. It could have been a love story. It could have been a redemption story. It could have been a new culture assimilation piece. Had the filmmakers looked at the story through just one of those three scopes (and just bolstered it with shades of the others), it would really have worked.Unfortunately, director Craig Gillespie (or maybe the Disney producers) tries to cram every single theme possible into one movie. It really feels like the old ""throw the kitchen sink at 'em"" method in terms of trying to evoke every possible emotion from the audience. I realize that this movie is supposed to have a broad, family-based appeal, but but focusing on everything the producers ended up focusing on nothing.The two biggest wastes in this movie? 1. Hamm, a terrific actor who plays as transparent of a character as one can see on screen; and 2. The fact that hard-core baseball fans like myself will not enjoy the baseball aspects of this movie. It is made for the family set first and foremost.Thus, though I wanted very badly to enjoy this movie and all the right pieces existed for that to happen, they just didn't come together. The ""Indian culture"" angle was interesting, but not nearly as compelling as, say, ""Slumdog Millionaire"", and recently baseball-themed movies like ""Trouble with the Curve"" and ""Moneyball"" will appeal much more to the die-hards."
" Million Dollar Movie?
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,8,"Baseball and cricket, two vastly different sports from totally different countries. The two sports are integrated into one movie in Craig Gillespie's Million Dollar Arm. In the movie Million Dollar Arm, J.B. Bernstein must find a client to sign or his career as a sports agent will be over. J.B. invests all his time and effort into finding a cricket star who he hopes to turn into a major league baseball player. To find his golden goose, he holds a contest called the Million Dollar Arm in order to find someone who can throw a ball both accurately and quickly enough to compete in the major league. J.B. eventually stumbles upon two potential clients, Rinku Singh and Dinesh Patel who prove to be promising clients. The two Indian boys must overcome the overwhelming American culture, while J.B. must mother and coach the two eighteen year old boys. Although Million Dollar Arm may seem like any other cliché sports movie with an underdog, the film is much more than the stereotypes and is about culture, compassion, and risk.J.B. Bernstein is a total wreck in the beginning of the movie. His life is a mess because he will lose his job if he does not find a client soon. He remembers what a friend was mentioning to him earlier in the week about cricket being extremely popular, so he watches cricket late at night and he has a brilliant idea to turn a cricket player into a baseball pitcher. To find the cricket player, he must travel to India, where cricket is extremely popular. J.B. Bernstein is overwhelmed by the vast culture of India and shares his unique experience with his neighbor, Brenda Fenwick, through video chat. India's culture is obviously quite different from America's, but J.B. Bernstein is too focused on finding his new client that he is blind to the fact. The boys are sent to stay at J.B.'s house since they had no where else to go. J.B. is furious at first, but his neighbor helps him to understand that the boys are just kids and are a far way from home and are homesick in a brand new environment. J.B. is confused by a scent coming from the boys' room. They are praying with their heads bowed and had burned incense and J.B. does not know what to think of what the boys are doing.Compassion is a key trait that J.B. must quickly adopt because he needs to look after two foreign children without any experience. After he discovers Rinku and Dinesh, he brings them back to America where the kids are overwhelmed by the huge transition into the United States. Dinesh and Rinku are even amused by something we, Americans, often overlook, an elevator. The kids are so amused that they play with the elevator several times and stick their arm between the doors as they are about to close so that the doors open. They find the doors opening to be magic and have never seen anything like it before. The hotel that they were staying in, with the elevator, later notified J.B. about a situation at the hotel. The boys cause a huge inconvenience to hotel staff and other guests by setting off an alarm. J.B. leaves them alone and they all go to a party later at night. J.B. is too caught up in his own job and maintaining his reputation that he loses sight of Rinku and Dinesh. They had wondered off at the party's and had eaten and drank a little too much. J.B. does not realize that the boys are feeling sick until someone tells him about a problem that the boys are causing. J.B. has to take them home, but on the ride home, the boys throw up in the car leaving J.B.'s new van covered in vomit. J.B. and the boys soon grow close with each other with the help from a translator named Amit. J.B. grows so close, that he even shares details about his complicated relationship with his neighbor, Brenda Fenwick. J.B. takes a huge risk by going to India and bringing two boys overseas and training them to become MLB pitchers. He also risks his reputation as a sports agent and could make a potential fool of himself if this fails. At the boys' first MLB tryout, he looks crazy because the tryout is in the middle of a parking lot of a shopping mall and the boys pitch the ball very inaccurately. The boys are depressed at how poorly they performed, but J.B. takes another risk by assuring them that they will have another chance, but a lot of people begin to decline because they heard about the disaster in the shopping mall. However, he fortunately finds a tryout with other MLB scouts and they eventually are drafted to a team. Nevertheless, all J.B.'s mission was based on risk and found success with the slimmest of chances.Million Dollar Arm was much more than an ordinary sports movie. It is about compassion, culture, and risk and also combines the qualities of a regular sports movie with hints of Disney throughout the movie."
