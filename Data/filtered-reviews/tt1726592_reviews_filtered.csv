" Still better than Memento
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,7,"Novel scenario, good characters and will keep you guessing until the end."
" Very poor ending.. makes no sense!!! An evil twin would have been better !!!
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,1,"As i watched along, i keep adding stars until the almost end. it drops from 9 stars to 1 stars. i got disappointed totally because it does not make sense at all.Give me a twin character, that would better explain the life time pictures she saw on the wall.however, this movie messed it up with the ending, Mike the bad guy WAS the husband based on the wedding pictures on the wall.. baby pictures he kept and so on... this movie just does not make sense at all!!!"
" Good Drama/ thriller
",2021-02-11 00:00:00,7,"Amazing drama thriller that tells the tale of a women who is left amnesiac after a ""car accident"" . Her husband explains every morning about her condition, their relationship, and the car accident.

" Memento - alike BIGTS makes a decent watch for the weekend
",2021-02-08 00:00:00,6,"Christine (Nicole Kidman) suffers from anterograde amnesia meaning that she cannot form any new memories since an accident that she had in the past. Every day she wakes up next to her husband (Colin Firth) having no memory of what happened yesterday or the day before. Each day her husband has to remind her of her condition since she cannot make sense of anything. Christine gets really upset since she doesn't remember him or the accident. The situation gets more frustrating after she receives a strange call from a psychiatrist Dr.Nasch (Mark Strong) who explains her that she is seeing him for months for help and it is normal to not remember him. Christine finds out that she cannot trust anyone and she must plan her moves cleverly to keep record of each day passing in order to find out what happened to her. Before I go to sleep might seem a very interesting idea at first playing with the short memory loss thingy but it is no new ground. Christopher Nolan was the first director that flirted with the condition with his amazing movie, Memento. Before I go to sleep comes not even close to his masterpiece but that doesn't mean you won't find it interesting. The whole movie is about guessing who is lying and there are a couple of twists to keep you interested. There are not many characters so you will change your opinion a dozen times of who is the guilty party until the end of the movie. The acting is top notch especially Christine's husband Ben played by Colin Firth. Unfortunately the movie falls flat at the end because it raises your expectations for something good but it just doesn't deliver. However before I go to sleep will keep you interested from start to finish thus making it decent watch for the weekend. If you loved this movie then watch Memento which is superior in every way."
" I did not expect that!
",2020-12-04 00:00:00,6,"It got off to a slow start so I skipped through to the midway point at which time it picked up. I watched til the end sometimes sitting on the edge of my chair.To be honest, I watched the movie because of Colin Firth and Nicole Kidman although I was familiar with this type of amnesia. Coincidentally, I had seen a documentary a couple of weeks ago about a man who, as a result of a brain infection in his 40s, suffered from chronic anterograde and retrograde amnesia. The man is Clive Wearing. He was a distinguished musicologist. He is 82 and still living. The documentary is The Man With the Seven Second Memory. There is lots of information on him on the internet about him."
" well crafted with great performances
",2020-11-21 00:00:00,8,"It certainly is not a masterpiece but it is surprising, well written and very well performed by the actors involved. it's a bit sluggish at times and slow tempo'ed from start to finish, but it delivers and keeps you guessing until the end. time well spent watching a good movie."
" Good movie lots of Questions
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,6,"So why did the real Ben HAVE to stay a way for Adam's Sake?
Why would Ben let another man basically steal his wife?
How come none of the family members reached out for 14 years?
How did Ben Assume she was is no danger? SHE HAS AMNESIA and seemingly went missing from the nursing home."
" Edge of your seat storyline. Must watch thriller
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,10,Brilliant film with a gripping storyline that keeps you fixated & has you on the edge of your seat throughout. Great acting from both lead roles & the ending packs a twist. Really enjoyed and suggest anyone who enjoys a Thriller to watch this movie!
" Plotless
",2020-10-28 00:00:00,1,Bewildered at the end. What was this all about? It all starts promising. But after watching you will be confused. So dont watch this movie.
" Entertaining thriller but not that great
",2020-09-24 00:00:00,6,"The acting is solid on all fronts and there are some very good moments. Ultimately though, there are too many plot holes to keep this believable. Too bad since I though the super dark take on the 50 First Dates concept (one of my favorite guilty pleasures!) was quite interesting as a premise."
" Keeps you guessing from the get-go.
",2020-08-30 00:00:00,7,"Before I Go to Sleep is a 2014 mystery psychological thriller film written and directed by Rowan Joffe and based on the 2011 novel Before I Go to Sleep by S. J. Watson. An international co-production between the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Sweden, the film stars Nicole Kidman, Mark Strong, Colin Firth, and Anne-Marie Duff.The story follows a woman (Nicole Kidman) who wakes up every day with no memory as the result of a traumatic accident in her past. One day, terrifying new truths begin to emerge that make her question everything she thinks she knows about her life.Before I go to Sleep is a solid psychological thriller which works on many levels. It is a taut, succinctly-told story that keeps you guessing throughout its concise running time, thanks in no small part to its three protagonists. A persistent score keeps emotions and tension running high while nebulous titles and grainy video footage evoke the faded and partial memories so crucial to the secret-ridden narrative. Kidman and Firth are both excellent in their sadness and savagery, Kidman, in particular, takes honors for her smart, un-showy work, conveying desperation with her eyes and terror in the way she refuses to trust anyone with her real emotion. In short, the movie works, although probably not so well as the book does."
" Boring & depressing
",2020-08-25 00:00:00,2,"It was well acted with Colin Firth & Nicole Kidman, but I found it boring, depressing. The surprise ending that some spoke about was not surprising at all. I suspected it from the beginning, so it was a letdown to see that's actually the way they chose to end it. I live in a state where we have constant sunshine & evergreen trees & couldn't stand the gray skies, leaf barren trees & sad little music that added to this depressing film"
" The book is better!
",2020-08-25 00:00:00,5,"I have read the book, which I really enjoyed so I was excited to see the screen adaptation. But it was just... not good. Mediocre. The actors did a good job and saved what could have been a total disaster. I would recommend reading the book, you get more action and thrill out of it."
" Gripping but filled with plot holes
",2020-07-02 00:00:00,7,"It draws you in, build the suspense and makes you really like the lead.
It just exists in a world where no other people exist and nor does any authority with sense or a search engine."
" A story that starts with a thousand pieces
",2020-06-26 00:00:00,6,You've got to be patient with this one or you may let it go inside 10 minutes. Some good acting from N. Kidman and C. Firth but they couldn't move it along to carry it. I was in a Skype meeting while I watched this. I gave it a six but was considering a lower score. The final 10 minutes save this movie.
" Before I Go To Sleep prevents narcolepsy yet succumbs to the forgettable deficiency of an amnesiac.
",2020-06-07 00:00:00,5,"Domestic thrillers, much like memories, could last an eternity or a short-term duration amongst the saturation of its genre. Particular scenes, images or performances could always assist in refreshing one's mind, cementing an ornate memorability in the process. Much like Christine whom, after an anonymous brutal attack, suffers from amnesia to which her memories reset whenever she sleeps. Waking up everyday with a rebooted mind. She, with the assistance of a neuropsychologist, records footage of her previous day with a digital camera she hides from her husband so that, when she wakes up, she can acknowledge her current stance and previous life. Attempting to recall the attack, someone is secluding the truth from her as she swiftly learns to trust nobody, including a devoted husband and doctor.Joffé's psychological mystery, based on Watson's novel of the same name, is a clinically serviceable thriller that regrettably succumbs to genre clichés. This is not the first thriller to confront amnesia, with Nolan's innovative 'Memento' raising the benchmark to stratospheric heights. However, whilst the aforementioned feature hosted a fragmented narrative structure, Joffé settled for a straightforward linear approach, certainly enhancing the accessibility of its mystery without the requirement of a notebook and/or advanced IQ brain. It enables the leading performances to control the story and, most importantly, keep viewers awake. Firth and Strong remain as dependable as ever, supplying meticulously engineered performances that insert doubt into the audience's assertions, the former especially exuding an impartial menace. Kidman, despite her occasional monotone facial reactions to certain scenarios, takes control of the plot and depicts a fragile yet determined woman whom has to battle her condition and the lies of individuals surrounding her.The problem unfortunately is nestled within Joffé's screenplay. Aside from the few contradictory statements regarding Christine's diagnosis, and convenient moments of remembrance despite the fact she's been tainted with this deficit for various years, Joffé succumbs to the narrative trap of reinforcing a facade. The double bluff. He expends much of the runtime implementing a crazed diversion through the character of Christine, masquerading the obviously inevitable plot twist. The first two thirds, notwithstanding the fast pace and functional technical elements, revolved around Christine and the possibility that her fractured mind is forcing her to doubt herself and others. Offering the idea that she is mentally unstable and that everyone is telling the truth. The issue being that, considering its genre, we know that's not the case and so therefore that third act reveal loses all of its proposed impact due to dancing around of its revelatory nature. Consequently the climactic third is rushed, expositional and lacks any emotional significance.This is the type of domestic thriller that would be more efficient as a limited television series. Its narrative substance is too menial and derivative for the restrictions of a feature film and is absent of cinematic edge. However, the final product is a serviceable mystery with three confidently dependable performances that manage to captivate for the most part. Although, rather ironically, you won't remember it the next day."
" I'll Look At Anything With Nicole Kidman In It
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,6,"Nicole Kidman wakes to discover she has no memory of anything that has happened since she was in college. She's 41 and married to Colin Firth, apparently. The phone rings. It's Mark Strong, explaining he's her psychiatrist, and she's been keeping a visual diary....actually, it's audio. As she struggles to put her life together afresh each day, she becomes aware she has a son, now dead; she develops a dread of Firth.It's a combination of MEMENTO with the 'Woman At Risk' genre of thriller, directed and co-written by Rowan Joffe. It's beautifully acted, given the strong cast, which includes Ann-Marie Duff, and the impulse to film the novel by S.J. Watson is clearly that Joffe, the son of Roland Joffe, has a mother suffering from some form of amnesia.Of course, Korsakoff's Syndrome doesn't work that way.It is usually the result of acute neurological damage, or caused by alcoholism disrupting the ability of long-term memories to form. However, it makes the basis of a pretty good thriller."
" A powerful performance by nicole kidman and colin firth.
",2020-05-27 00:00:00,8,"""Before I go to sleep"" is so mysterious and fun, I will discover a beautiful mix of drama and horror advanced so beautifully, the film scenario is so powerful and fun, events are always evolving, will see an extraordinarily marvellous performance by nicole kidman and colin werth his performance was so powerful and especially enjoyable in the end.The episode of before I go to sleep"" tells of a 40-year-old woman named Christine Lucas awake every morning and she doesn't remember what happened to her before today as a result of a car accident 10 years ago that caused nerve damage. Think of it as amnesia.As the days pass, terrifying truths about kristen da sala come to light, many questions revolve around her, beginning with her husband, Ben. What happened?"
" Good start, doesn't stick the landing
",2020-05-24 00:00:00,6,"POSITIVES:1) Colin Firth is actually very good, with a not so good script
2) For the first half of the film, the mystery is actually very engaging
3) The violence is very limited but when it's there it's proper violenceNEGATIVES:1) IT MAKES NO SENSE
2) Mark Strong (who I love) gets so little to do in the film that he seems like he's sleepwalking the entire time he's on screen
3) Mark Strong is supposed to be a doctor yet unbelievably he is allowed to spend hours every day going to see Nicole Kidman and isn't even charging her for it
4) HOW DOES THE CAMERA NEVER RUN OUT OF BATTERY
5) Everything after Kidman meets up with the character of Claire is awful. It's like the film's narrative jumps off a cliff and goes from actually interesting and engaging to excruciating awful and basically a soap opera"
" Nothing like the book
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,5,"Very disappointed, I quite enjoyed the book but this film gave the book no justice whatsoever. Nicole Kidman is always a letdown but overall the film was poor."
" Good realisation,visually pleasing to watch, not much more
",2020-05-07 00:00:00,4,"I would like start by saying Mark Strong and Colin Firth is always good!Nicole Kidman boring and plastic face and also that distraught/lost looking facial expression is overused by her. I used to really like her, ever since that BMX kid movie. In the last few months i've watch lots of movies with those 3 actors.(confinement period oblige)
she's the only I was tired of seeing. she does sometimes still give great performancesNow for the movie it will be short lol
based on a book, that was probably based on other similar movies or books plots, because it's overdone, used too many times in too many stories.
the memory lost everynight and kind of reliving the same start of day over and over.
A person who profits from that memory lost and another who truly want to help you but looks like he or she is the person who is doing you or has done you wrong.
same blah blah like the other movies and then at the end all is reveiled and the person with lost memory get's it back and live happily ever after.
guess the review isn't that short lol"
" Very clever and very surprising.
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,9,"Excellent film, very clever plot. Unusual casting with Colin Firth, only ever seen him as ""nice"". The film keeps you guessing all the way through. Very very clever."
" a safe movie before going to sleep
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,6,"Film director Rowan Joffe was brave when he decided to make 'Before I Go to Sleep' (2013). Amnesia is an excellent premise for the psychological thriller genre. The challenge, however, is difficult for screenwriters and filmmakers who are venturing into this genre, as the quality benchmark is somewhere high. At least two films are references in this genre: Hitchcock's 'Spellbound' from 1945 and Christopher Nolan's 'Memento' from 2000. Rowan Joffe enjoyed working with an excellent cast with Nicole Kidman and Colin Firth in the lead roles, and based on a script he wrote himself (adaptation of a novel). As a script author, Joffe had some successes, among which '28 Weeks Later' which was viewed and commented broadly in recent weeks because it has as theme England after a pandemic. However, if we are to consider 'Before I Go to Sleep', the film director Rowan Joffe fails to rise to the same level as the screenwriter Rowan Joffe.We are dealing in this film with an unusual triangle of characters. Christine, a 40-year-old woman, wakes up every morning in bed with a man she doesn't know. Ben explains her every time that he is her husband, and that she has lost her memory for the last 20 years. He goes to work, she remains alone at home, and then the phone rings. At the other end of the conversation is Dr. Nash, a psychiatrist who is trying to help her recover her lost memory using video recordings. The routine is repeated every day (there are no weekend days in this movie!) As time goes on, information about Christine's traumatic buried past begins to gather. But is this information accurate? Can the lonely and vulnerable woman trust any of the two men? What role did they play in her previous life and in the events that caused her amnesia?I will not reveal anything more about the story, but it is clear that there are in the scenario the premises of a good psychological thriller, with hidden identity games, conflicts between reality and imagination, between memory and traumatic forgetfulness. As a film director, Rowan Joffe adopts a neutral, sterile style, better fit to a television drama. Nicole Kidman's acting saves some of the film, but she can't fill in for the lack of chemistry or tension with Colin Firth, an actor whose interpretations I confess that seldom convince me. The film could have been much darker and more tense if the directorial approach had been different. From what could have been a good horror movie we remain only with an acceptable thriller. This is not to be neglected either, at least 'Before I Go to Sleep' is a safe movie to watch before going to sleep."
" Mediocre
",2020-04-09 00:00:00,6,"The movie is mostly predictable.
I will give it credit for switching the plot in the middle of the movie, but the end result still is predictable from the very start.
Extra point for the emotional scene at the end.6/10"
" 50 First Dates - Ever Hear of It?
",2020-04-08 00:00:00,5,"I couldn't believe when I started watching this. The premise is exactly 50 First Dates. Did everyone forget that movie? I loved that movie, haha.
This one is much more serious, a murder mystery.
I like both Firth and Kidman. So I watched it through.
It's okay, not great not horrible."
" So not good
",2020-03-15 00:00:00,2,"I knew better but decided to waste my time anyway. Nicole Kidman wakes up every day with no memory back to the time of her accident/attack twentyish years ago. What a snooze. It's like it doesn't even matter that there are holes in the story because it's so boring that fixing it isn't worth it. Nicole Kidman whispers every word (?) is that supposed to be tentative? Ah me, give me Birthday Girl."
" Twist, yea, but motivation?
",2020-03-05 00:00:00,5,"Motivation must underlie any good movie, of any genre, to have any legitimacy. Why does a character do something bizarre must have some reason; otherwise the author is just playing with you, doing a 52 card pickup with possible plot twists. This movie has great actors, of course, and has a bit of the ""Momento"" issues going on. But the key development, an action by one of these actors, has zero reason behind it, just wham, out of the blue when things were okay. I gave a five, cause worth watching, I guess, just to see what the twist is, and to watch these fine actors, except that I think the fine actor at the center of the twist ought to have insisted on some apparent motivation for the sudden turn in behavior."
" Mediocre
",2020-03-05 00:00:00,5,"The story reminds me of Memento (2000).
The plot was quite exciting.
Overall, an average thriller that gets 5/10."
" Mushy, watered down Memento
",2020-02-29 00:00:00,6,"There's a lot of movies about amnesia and it's probably hard to bring something new and innovative into that genre. This movie tries by mixing it up with ""strong woman vs psychopath"" kind of story, and as far as I'm concerned it fails, the strong woman isn't all that strong and the psychopath turns out to be some guy hopelessly in love with her, and he doesn't really do psychopath things till the end nor does she do strong woman things till the end. And after that the movie goes full mushy with family reunion scenes and whatnot. It's hard to call it a thriller when there's only one real plot twist, and it's a very predictable one. Probably a good movie for Nicole Kidman fans who will get amused by a closeup shots of her pupils and her forever frightened facial expression, but true thriller fans should look for their piece of entertainment elsewhere"
" The opening 20 min pulls you right in
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,6,The opening 20 min pulls you right in but after that everything gets kind of predictable. The main characters are great in the film.
" Why, oh, why?
",2019-12-30 00:00:00,4,"Why, oh, why does 'mike'go through all the efforts of being 'Ben' and recreating a history? He could have called himself Mike and make up a totally other and more simple history. By then again there would be no movie would there?"
" I'm left with so many questions...
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,4,"The main reason I have so many questions is because the story is just totally unbelievable and illogical.
... (review continues below) ...
How is is possible for someone to hold someone hostage like this without anyone noticing? The main character seems to wake up anxious and confused every day, yet somehow the person who kept her has managed to fabricated a wall full of happy pictures with him and her. She has a form of amnesia that can happen after severe trauma, but how is it that the psychiatrist is just contacting her to keep her updated? You would think that when someone has such a severe case of amnesia all of the family would be involved in the therapy and he would at least meet with the husband every now and then....And many more questions. Perhaps I misunderstood certain things because I got distracted, because it was also a boring movie at times.Finally, I'm sorry to tell you Colin, but you are just no good as a mean person. I get that you don't always want to be typecasted as a English gentleman, but I'm afraid this type of role isn't working for you. Just stick to what you know best."
" But a weak 8
",2019-12-26 00:00:00,8,"How the antagonist got away with doing this requires a bit too much suspension of disbelief.
.

.
The antagonist was able to keep her hostage for four years without the real Ben and Adam Lucas (ex-husband and son) inquiring on the whereabouts of the protagonist (Christine Lucas)?"
" Luckily I didn't watch this ""Before I Go to Sleep""
",2019-11-29 00:00:00,6,"Foremost, I was entertained by this movie. It isn't a disaster but it's not as good as I expected to be. Nicole Kidman is the highlight of the movie. She shows again she is a great actress and Colin Firth is a great co-star. They both are the best part of the movie because they are extraordinary actors. But the pacing in the story is so slow that you don't get caught up until the second half of the film.Moreover, the movie feels so cold, I mean, visually is boring, it isn't something extraordinary. It seems like a TV film. It's so boring that most of the time you feel like this is not moving on. I almost got sleep.The twist is very good, and the final fight makes it worthy at the end."
" Too many plot-holes but still enjoyable
",2019-11-25 00:00:00,7,"This movie reminds me of memento and i loved that movie, the story started very well and i would rate this movie 9 or 10 if they had continued making sense but for people who likes to analyze things the movie has gone wrong to be honest cause they are some things illogic here and can't be overlooked, first of all if mike picked her up 4 years ago so how is that no one ever checked on her ?? She doesn't have friends or family !! Second , since he hit her very hard with a bottle which caused her to lose consciousness , how he managed to pick her from the hotel and toss her in that place where she was found !! it's obvious that this hotel has surveillance cameras ! , how is that people working in that hotel didn't notice that !! Surely it wasn't like he put her on her pocket and walked out the door unnoticed !! There are too many other plot holes , However despite this plot holes the movie is fun to watch"
" Kidding around with Mrs. Kidman
",2019-11-06 00:00:00,6,"In my beloved home country - the beautiful Belgium - there's a channel that is officially named Five-TV, but it's commonly known as ""Wife-TV"" because it's exclusively targeted at women aged 15-65. All day long they air shows like ""Sex and the City"" and ""Grey's Anatomy"", and the movies they program are either feelgood romantic comedies or heart-breaking TV-movies inspired by true stories. Once every two months or so, Wife-TV also programs thrillers/wannabe horror movies, but of course only if the female lead is a famous and respectable Hollywood actress. Since my own darling wife is a fan of this particular TV-channel, I already had the pleasure of watching stuff like ""The Premonition"" (starring Sandra Bullock), ""The Forgotten"" (starring Julianne Moore) and ""Gothika"" (starring Halle Berry"", and last weekend it was Nicole Kidman's turn with the kitchen-bedroom thriller ""Before I go to Sleep"".Mrs. Kidman depicts the 40-something Christine who suffers from a dreadfully annoying condition. Every morning she wakes up not knowing who she is, who the man next to her in bed is, or what happened in her entire life thus far. Each day, her loving and caring husband Ben (Colin Firth) has to calm the hysterical Christine down and re-explain to her they are married since several years and that she lost her whole memory due to a terrible accident. Thanks to a secret therapist and a tape recorder, however, Christine gradually discovers more about herself, as well as about Ben and the so-called accident which actually was a brutally aggressive attack in a hotel room.The plot is incredibly far-fetched and quite implausible (I can't picture myself anyone who could or would want to live like this) but I'm also not too ashamed to admit that ""Before I go to Sleep"" remains reasonably entertaining and compelling throughout the entire running time. This is definitely thanks to the engaged performances of Nicole Kidman and Colin Firth, with strong support from Mark Strong and Anne-Marie Duff. It's a small but very professional cast, to say the least, and Mrs. Kidman is obviously very familiar with this sort of troubled and mentally tormented characters. The plot comes across as predictable and derivative, but it does have a very surprising and unforeseeable plot-twist in store at the end; - one that I certainly appreciated being a fan of mysteries, whodunits and Gialli."
" Amnesia based Thriller !
",2019-08-16 00:00:00,7,"Nicol Kidman suffers from an unusual kind of Amnesia where She cannot remember while getting up every morning till that days memory loss !. Her routine, Language, Speech remains normal but forgets even Who she is ! and Where and why What and When !!!. Gradually some hinting sparks reveals a little and situation is exploited. Induction of a psychiatrist gives a Medical Perspective to whole suspense revealing story. The advise by psychiatrist to tackle the issue is wonderful and a new concept. Digital cam recording is to be done at night about latest status of surroundings who where why when what queries whom to trust whom etc... ! Doc will phone her You are mrs so and so and will inform her there is one digital camera put and she is suppose to watch it so that lost memory is restored !!! As doc is suppose to inform only camera location without fail whatever latest up- date is kept secret as well !! Her amnesia is such that she even forgets her name, what she has recorded at night the arrangement is to be recalled and restored !!! ! This is to be done on daily bases !! I really enjoyed this arrangement ! Then a Crime Story is well knitted, acted, directed, scripted with this back ground. NK is known for giving this kind of challenging roles. We are told the story unfolding with NK character's struggle each day ! So wonderfully done with maintaining the interest.
It is easy to surprise us in unfolding some hidden secrets but done with this kind of tool makes the movie a newer kind."
" Interesting movie
",2019-08-01 00:00:00,7,"Interesting movie that keeps you guessing, and thus keeps you watching to the end. Great cast, which is what drew me to view this. However, there are many plot holes (which I won't go into as it would be a repetition of what other reviewers have mentioned).
The thing that stood out for me ultimately was the bond between a mother and child. When Mike was assaulting Christine at the hotel in the final scenes, what gave her the extra strength to fight back and escape was finding out that her son, Adam, was alive. At that point I thought, whatever happens, never try and keep a loving mother from her child!"
" my notes
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,7,"Great movie, kept me into it throughout. good story, acting and direction (1 viewing)"
" Snooze fest
",2019-06-18 00:00:00,5,"Before I Go To Sleep is a bit of a snooze fest. Im gutted to say that as the story was promising and Colin Firth and Mark Strong are wonderful actors. Nicole Kidman was a huge disappointment, like her character she is bland and made this a frustrating watch with her emotionless and spaced notion. The story too is very slowly paced however just as began to lose interest it sparked its revival. With the lack of characters and cast the 'twist' wasn't much of a surprise but was the best part of the film by a mile. The ending wasn't quite as strong as it could have been either. Overall this movie is too padded with too much unnecessary filler and repetitiveness to be thoroughly enjoyed."
" Don't
",2019-05-27 00:00:00,5,"I read the book before watching this movie. It was amazing! The changes they made to the story to turn it to a movie weakened it a lot!
It is not horrible, but there's a lot of better thriller movies."
" I really enjoyed this film.
",2019-04-29 00:00:00,7,"Before I Go to Sleep successfully immerses you in a world of chaos in a way that a lot of other films fail. It can be incredibly difficult to adequately capture turmoil - particularly when that turmoil is largely internal and psychological - as opposed to an external event.Whilst a lot of films do well to portray catastrophes they focus almost entirely on the event itself, and fall more into the Action genre than that of Thriller/Suspense.Before I Go to Sleep is a great example of a film that does the opposite - it focuses more on our own perceptions, and does a great job at making us feel like we are really a part of the intense drama the protagonist goes through.Because the film's main theme revolves around memory, or lack thereof, it could be easy for it to fall into a whole host of pitfalls regarding continuity and logical temporal progression. However, this title handles it well. It's complex enough to keep you engaged, yet does not feel convoluted or hard to follow.As a suspense title it can be a little predictable at times, and perhaps the twists that exist in the narrative are a little cliche, but as a Thriller it is sure to delight.Some of the jump scares are a little tacky and unnecessary, but overall the majority of the film does quite well at not only keeping you entertained but intrigued.The acting is superb and ultimately believable - which is vital in this genre. If the main characters emotions did not feel authentic you'd certainly loose the deep sense of foreboding and hopelessness that pervades the title from beginning to end.I really enjoyed this film and I'm sure many others will also. Whilst plot predictability and the seemingly pointless jump scares prevent it from perfection this is still a brilliant film and has earned a 7/10.7* - Great"
" Intriguing
",2019-03-11 00:00:00,8,"I'm not a big fan of Nicole Kidman so the fact that I gave this film such a high rating means that she overcame my prejudices. She is wonderful, as are her supporting cast members. But what is more intriguing is the story itself, which will keep you guessing. Yes it's a little bit slow,l but that is part of the charm."
" What exciting is going to happen today?
",2019-02-08 00:00:00,9,"I absolutely enjoyed the novel, so I was slightly hesitant for a while to watch the film. Then the opportunity came to see it, so I tried not to think too much about the book while watching. It was actually a really good adaptation, I thought. Nicole Kidman played the role with a heartbreaking reality, Mark Strong was great as Dr. Nash, and Colin Firth was good as Ben. Yes, Memento may be the better movie, but for genuine emotion, this one really broke my heart, in a good way. :-)"
" Chopped up version of the novel
",2019-02-05 00:00:00,5,"When I was a kid I read The Guns of Navarone. When the movie was on TV I was excited to think that I was going to watch the book I had enjoyed so much in live action. The reality was a learning experience that still holds true almost 50 years later that a movie is generally a pale imitation of its source novel.Before I Go to Sleep was a decent novel that I would rate 7/10. The movie is a hacked up version of the novel that is miscast and a poor representation of a novel that wasn't that good in the first place. If I hadn't read the novel I would have had no idea what was going on and I can't believe that S J Watson was happy with it.The movie had so much that was vital to the meaning of the story missed out and other details changed for no obvious reason. There was an opportunity to make a gritty British suspense thriller but despite apparently still being set in London we end up with what feels like a half-hearted Hollywood effort.In the end, my most notable memory of Before I Go to Sleep is that despite the very small cast I recognised 2 actors from Game of Thrones!"
" The concept ruins the entire thing
",2019-02-05 00:00:00,4,"Intriguing memory loss drama/thriller that keeps you guessing for a while. It's not great but is watchable and is engaging. However, at the end when the concept is revealed, you realise the whole idea is so ludicrous that it renders the entire film way too far fetched to be believable or even enjoyable.Spoiler - the big, ludicrous, reveal at the end is that Kidman was in a mental hospital but got signed out by her lover Colin Farrell using false documents. The idea that her real husband had never bothered to report her missing but instead had stayed away to ""protect their son"" who was distraught as his amnesiac mother not knowing who he was, was insanely ridiculous. And what about all her friends and colleagues? No one wondered where she had gone or tried to look for her?This reminded me of Prisoners (2013), which was quite a thrilling watch until the ending when some of the ideas behind the concept are just too unbelievable to be acceptable."
" Decent mystery film
",2019-02-02 00:00:00,6,"I found the experience overall to be not bad, but not great, either. The story held my interest well enough and the twists were decent. It's well-acted, well-directed and tense (even emotional) when it needs to be. This is one of those films that is decent and enjoyable to an extent, but I'm not sure if I could say that the experience was worth it."
" ""I wonder what's going to happen exciting today.""
",2019-01-30 00:00:00,7,"The film maintains a certain amount of psychological tension up to a point, but the longer it goes on, it becomes less and less credible. The main sticking point for me is the idea that for the length of time Christine (Nicole Kidman) was left without her memory for the past fourteen years, nobody but nobody else in the entire world knew about her condition apart from the man who assumed her husband's identity, and the neurologist (Mark Strong) treating her condition. There was Claire (Anne-Marie Duff) too of course, but what about Chrissy's own family and friends who would have known her prior to the accident? And her own ex-husband who didn't have a clue she was living with another man? It's a small world in almost every other respect, so how could he not have kept tabs on his former wife, even if he could no longer live with the stress and anxiety of her condition?Take all those parameters out of the story and it might have worked, though the 'husband' who turned out to be an imposter (Colin Firth) would have to be considered a mental case himself for assuming the masquerade for four years. Taking his love for Chrissy to the extreme that he did would have required a tremendous amount of manipulation with the people he knew, those at his place of employment, and virtually anyone in the immediate neighborhood, which for the sake of story, did seem to be a rather isolated one.The best I can say about the picture is that Nicole Kidman did an outstanding job portraying someone who struggles to grasp what memories she can out of her past. Most of her role required the requisite amount of grief, tension and horror associated with not knowing who one was or is supposed to be. But the story's ultimate resolution stretched for a feel good ending that didn't come across as very likely or even credible. And even worse to contemplate for Chrissy, who's memory was slightly returning, was what would happen once the hospital visit with her newly discovered son was over with."
" Nice twist
",2019-01-29 00:00:00,8,"Very well acted and good story with a fantastic twist. Thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Small but extremely talented cast and although unbelievable, the story was great. The music and direction were top class too."
" O.K. But Not Great
",2019-01-29 00:00:00,6,"BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP is a thriller about a woman suffering from memory loss. Basically it's the same setup as FIFTY FIRST DATES, where the woman forgets everything from the previous day upon waking. Except this time it's not a romantic comedy. It's a dark thriller.The acting is good and the story is fine, but not great. It feels cheesy and contrived at times, but it's never boring and entertaining enough. It's not as good as FIFTY FIRST DATES, but it's a different kind of movie and the premise is intriguing. It is NOT, however, the kind of movie that will make you think or anything like that. Recommend if you just want a cheap thrill."
" Loved the twist!
",2019-01-22 00:00:00,7,"As usual, Nicole & Colin were great and the twist that happens within the movie was unexpected!"
" Whoa!
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,8,"Claire Lucas (Nicole Kidman) wakes up every morning to Ben (Colin Firth) sleeping in her bed. The only problem is that she doesn't remember who he is or that she's not the 20-year-old she once was. Every morning, Ben reminds Claire that he's her husband and that she's now 40. He also reminds her that she's been in an accident ten years ago, which explains why she cannot remember anything.With the help of neurologist Dr Mike Nasch (Mark Strong), she her memory starts to resurface and she is faced with something that nobody should be forced to face, let alone be her reality.You expect the story to be one thing, but as her memories start to resurface, with the help of neurologist Dr. Mike Nash, a web of lies unravels, and you find out that it's another thing entirely!
You question as to what's going on and who's to blame. This, however, is predictable, and even though you can see what's coming (or, at least you suspect what's coming), the twist still seems to slap you in the face!The plot is nothing original, as it has somewhat been done in '50 First Dates', just in a slightly different way, as it was a comedy, not a psychological thriller as this movie is. However, the acting, directing, musical score and lighting are superb! The makeup could have been done better. I'm not saying that it wasn't good, but some of the makeup effects disappear for a bit in some of the film where it should have stayed.According to IMDB's trivial facts, Nicole studied people with amnesia, including watching a documentary on Clive Wearing called, 'Clive Wearing, living without memory', which is about a man who got viral encephalitis and, as a result, cannot remember anything after ten minutes. He wakes up every morning and greets his wife as if he hasn't seen her in years. He also keeps a diary of what has happened each day, recording the times these events happen.Again, both Colin Firth and Nicole Kidman play their roles particularly well and the directing is superb!This is definitely a movie which I would see again! I would also recommend other people to see it."
" Nicole Kidman best performances.
",2019-01-03 00:00:00,9,"A stylish, somewhat brutal, Brit-centric bedtime story about deception, danger and Nicole Kidman in distress."
" The most interesting thing about this movie is ...
",2018-12-21 00:00:00,5,"Casting Colin Firth in the role he has in the movie. He does a good job but I just can't imagine the casting meeting when everyone was wracking their brains for potential actors and then someone exclaims ""I know! Let's get Colin Firth"""
" Waste of Time
",2018-12-11 00:00:00,3,"Watched this movie anticipating suspense and thrills,but didn't get that. There was nothing but tacky jump scenes like the air plane and truck passing by but nothing else. Yes, there were dramatic flashbacks,but they were pretty repetitious."

" FIFTY LAST DATES
",2018-11-28 00:00:00,7,"Christine (Nicole Kidman) has that daily amnesia thing that was so funny when Drew Barrymore had it. She keeps a secret camera log diary of her daily events to review the next day. She is being secretly helped by Dr. Mike Nasch (Mark Strong) while distrusting her husband Ben (Colin Firth) who she discovers lies to her, seemingly for her own protection. Christine discovers she was the victim of an brutal attack, as she tries to regain her memory and discover her attacker.The film introduces only two character/suspects, so its a coin toss Scooby-doo. It leans us one way then another. The story weave is fairly decent, but not overly clever enough to stand out. For those who loved ""Faces in the Crowd"" should like this one too, if they can handle it with just two faces.
Parental Guide: F-bomb, brief sex, brief Kidman butt nudity."
" I like Nicole Kidman movies, and this was at least worth a watch
",2018-10-15 00:00:00,3,"Before I Go to Sleep was a reasonably good movie. It was a thriller of sorts, and was a trip to go through the same experience as the main character, who suffered brain damage and could not remember anything when she woke up every morning (like Memento). It was a decent watch, maybe moreso for Nicole Kidman fans. To the majority of others, I would say skip it."
" potentially boring
",2018-09-30 00:00:00,8,"A subject and actors with a lot of potential - unfortunately the movie comes across somewhat academic, overexplaining every step. One of Colin Firth's more serious roles, but those suit him really well."
" Watch on Halloween or use for Adult Game Night
",2018-07-02 00:00:00,5,"Christine (Nicole Kidman) suffers from amnesia and literally can not remember one day to the next. As her husband Ben (Colin Firth) explains, she was in a car accident and suffered brain damage. In attempt to further her progress neuropsychologist, Dr. Nasch Mark Strong) gives her a video camera to record her thoughts of the day. He calls her each morning to remind her who he is, why he is calling, where to find the camera, what to do with it and then discuss any memories she has retained. I like psychological thrillers and thought with Nicole Kidman playing the lead it would be a better than average film, I was wrong. It is not the best or the worst thriller I've seen, but it is a bit average. It is good enough to watch on Halloween if you don't plan to go out or watch as a group for a who-done-it game night. Not for young viewers adult themes."
" Perfect
",2018-06-14 00:00:00,10,"It was such a good movie. Everything was perfect about it. Why did people rate it so low? It kept me entertained the whole time. I tried to watch ""no country for old men"" It was so boring I couldn't take it and switched to this one. Nicole Kidman is a stunning perfect woman who doesn't age. She's a great actress. I'm glad I found this after a long searching time. I found it by searching the tag ""mental patient"". I love horror and I watch every single one of them. This was more of a crime thriller mystery but I'm glad I watched it"
" Over rated movie
",2018-05-25 00:00:00,4,"This movie has no story and leaves a lot of questions. Why did the man named Mike have and control her for 4 years? He is the one who beat her. It was actually evident from the beginning of the movie who the villain was and after 5 minutes. I had it pegged. This should have been a ""B"" movie. I have seen better B movies with more mystery than this movie. 
Don't waste your time on this movie."
" Loved this film
",2018-03-25 00:00:00,9,Brilliantly gripping film with lots of twist and second guessing. The only thing that annoyed me was the fact that the director made a huge error forgetting to explain Claire's role... oops! But decides that it's well worth a watch!
" Confusion, Distrust & Lost Identity
",2018-03-12 00:00:00,7,"Thrillers in which the main protagonist is an amnesiac often provide great entertainment because it's natural to feel empathy for the victim and also to enjoy trying to solve the mystery surrounding how they arrived in their present predicament. Furthermore, by effectively being put in the shoes of the amnesiac, the audience experiences first hand all the discomforts, frustrations and doubts that come with the condition and share the natural suspicions that arise about the sincerity of the people who are closest to them. Lots of movies feature situations in which ""all is not as it seems"" or where characters are ""not who or what they appear to be"" but where there is an amnesiac involved, the scope for exploiting these types of dramatic incidences is almost endless and this is the territory that's explored, with some success in ""Before I Go To Sleep"".Christine Lucas (Nicole Kidman) is a 40-year-old woman who lives in a quiet part of Berkshire and wakes up each morning with no memory of who she is or the identity of the man with whom she shares her bed. She's always surprised when she looks in the mirror because, for some reason, she expects to see a woman in her twenties and then when she surveys the wall full of photos in her bathroom, sees a pictorial account of her life with her husband, Ben (Colin Firth). Each morning Ben updates her on who he and she are and explains that her memory loss is due to injuries that she suffered in a car accident about 10 years ago.Every morning, a little while after Ben has left for work, Christine receives a phone call from Dr Nasch (Mark Strong), a neuropsychologist who says he's been treating her for some time and directs her to a camera (that's located in her bedroom) in which, at his request, she's been keeping a video diary of her daily life, her thoughts and her feelings. Dr Nasch is hopeful that Christine's use of the video diary will eventually help to restore her memory and in the meetings that he has with her each day, tries to establish the extent to which she can recall the traumatic event that triggered her amnesia. She seems to show some promise of recovery when she starts to remember some brief but unconnected images from her past and some of these images are upsetting. One includes a man with a scar on his face and Dr Nasch tells her that her amnesia is the consequence of a violent attack which she was fortunate to survive.Christine doesn't know who to trust or why Dr Nasch insists that her contacts with him should be kept a secret from Ben but nevertheless, does as the Doctor requests. In one of her meetings with Nasch, Christine shows some interesting responses to being shown certain photographs and this leads to her meeting up with an old friend called Claire (Anne-Marie Duff) who ultimately supplies some information which proves to be critical to uncovering a series of important revelations and to Christine's eventual recovery.""Before I Go To Sleep"" is an absorbing thriller with a great set-up, an interesting story and a denouement which, although satisfactory, doesn't live up to the standard of the rest of the movie. Despite this, it's consistently compelling to watch, well-paced and played out in a series of locations that very effectively emphasize the fear, confusion and sense of isolation that Christine experiences during her ordeal.The acting performances in this stylish movie are all of a high quality with Nicole Kidman's portrayal of the troubled amnesiac standing out and Colin Firth and Mark Strong fuelling the mystery brilliantly by both being superbly enigmatic and difficult to read at various junctures. Overall, this is definitely a worthy addition to the sub-genre of psychological thrillers in which a character with amnesia is featured."
" Total Trash
",2018-01-08 00:00:00,1,"I saw no other reviewer here have the issues I did with this film. It was total trash.
How can anyone condone such brutality towards women--or anyone! Absolutely unnecessary to put such horrible scenes in a movie. Isn't there enough of this evil in real life? It was nauseating and I had to walk away from it. I used to like Nicole Kidman, but I am afraid I have lost respect for her to have done such a horrible script. Shame on her."
" Ok to watch for free, far from great.
",2017-12-24 00:00:00,4,"I saw this film without knowing the plot because I like Mark Strong, so I gave it a try. It started out ok for the first 30 minutes, then I started to skip to the scenes with Mark Strong in them as I was rapidly losing interest. The plot has too many holes to be believable or make any sense at all. How could Mike be able to take over the identity of another man Ben, for 4 years and not even one person suspect anything? The school that he was teaching at, all the staff and students had no problem seeing a different man with the same name? What about friends or relatives? How did they live in isolation for 4 years? Christine (Nicole Kidman) comes off more as whiny and self-pitying and no wonder Mike beat her and always got away with it. Is it so easy to forge documents to cheat the hospital into releasing a patient to live with a complete stranger and how did Mike manage to get hold of the son's birth certificate? Could that be easily forged as well? At the cafe, Dr Nasch said he'd pass her case to another neurologist as it'd be unethical and unprofessional to continue with the treatment yet he was sitting beside her hospital bed in the end. And how had Dr Nesch managed to call Christine every morning at the time so happened when Mike was out, to tell her about the camera? How did he know where she'd put the camera? Had he been in the house? And if he'd been in the house, he didn't suspect she was living with a total stranger? Why not used a voice recorder as to repeat the same thing to the same person everyday might get a little annoying? You mean he'd been doing this for 7 days a week for 4 years, and he still didn't suspect that she'd be living with a stranger, and Mike never suspected anything as well? Wouldn't Mike do something about the doctor if he was so bent on keeping his identity a secret? Wouldn't a doctor who was treating her for 4 years at least know what her husband look like and know she'd been living with a total stranger, and tried to warn her? The end, Christine's amnesia was not cured? So how'd the real Ben and son Adam showing up mean anything because she'd just forget them the next day? And after everything, she'd believe the man standing in front of her was the real Ben and not some other imposter? And it was Dr Nesch who called the real Ben? So he must have known the real Ben and there again, he didn't suspect she was living with a stranger for 4 years? And he'd be calling the wrong house all along because the real Ben was living with the son somewhere else? And the real Ben had supposedly dumped Christine in some sort of home, and Christine felt ok about it as she felt nothing when she saw him again? We go back to square one and nothing is improved or happened since the beginning. Colin Firth is wrongly cast because he's not convincing to play an abusive husband, his expression is blank and serious at most but not intimidating. I think it'd have worked better if he was the doctor and Mark Strong was the abusive lover instead. Christine is a mediocre character with no personality whatsoever and didn't evoke any sympathy or support. I half-hope Mike just beat her to death and be done with it, so sick to look at the plastic skin and bad hair that just made her look more like a creepy stalker. I'm sure all the actors try their best so I didn't fast-forward through the whole film much, and managed to watch the ending without skipping. Thank God I didn't pay to see it."
" The dark sad version of Groundhog Day.
",2017-11-28 00:00:00,6,"Amnesia can be a blessing in such a life of ""Nicole Kidman"". The woman who got hit,cheated on,kidnapped, and deprived from her son.The movie starts with a scene of Nicole's eyes, and yes it's a beautiful scene to start a movie with. Then we move to know that she has amnesia and living with her husband, after-that the events continue while she is trying to remember and solve the mystery behind her amnesia.The movie has really beautiful shots of different places, and the cinematographer did a great job of showing the beauty of symmetry in addition to the using of slow side to side movement of the camera which really resemble the nature of that kind of movies.There are not much people to suspect in that movie, so the finale is quiet expected but the director has a good twisted end for you.Finally, it's a good drama/mystery movie with thrill added in a perfect amount, you will enjoy it if you are looking for a small adrenaline rush."
" This will Botox your mind
",2017-10-22 00:00:00,9,"Before I go to sleep has been on my watchlist for a few years now. Last week I watched another movie with Colin Firth and Nicole Kidman in the leading roles. I really enjoyed their chemistry. Perhaps that's why I think the story-line and their acting adds up to the suspense of a good thriller, mystery and drama movie. I've read some recent reviews and in my opinion this movie is underrated. I haven't read the book so I don't know if the makers intended it to be as grim as it is. I do think that the gloominess of the weather and the characters are of added value to this movie. The character of Christine is confused as soon as she opens up her eyes and sees her world every morning. As much as I would like to forget my life most times, I wouldn't like to wake up and remembering absolutely nothing of the past 20 years. Including the house I'm in and the man sleeping next to me. I can imagine her anxiety very well. Her being played by Nicole Kidman and her having a rather emotionless visage, it was hard for me to read the expressions on her face. I did enjoy the roles and expressions of Colin Firth and Mark Strong. What I most look for in a movie with the genres of Mystery and Thriller are characters that surprise me. Who aren't what they seem to be. And in this flick some characters get another plot turn. 9 Out of 10 for me, because the last 5-10 minutes were too slow. Enjoy the watch, it's a good one!"
" Why So Serious?
",2017-08-20 00:00:00,5,"If cinema was invented solely so that we could spend an hour or two watching beautiful actresses emote in closeup, then BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP is great cinema. Nicole Kidman plays Christine, a woman fully functioning in every way except that a head trauma from a mysterious assault has left her with only short-term memory: every night as she sleeps, she forgets everything about herself, and has to relearn her identity the next day. There are worse ways of spending one's brief time on earth than watching Ms. Kidman register confusion, surprise, fear, curiosity, determination and (reflecting the audience's feelings) more confusion. It is hard, however, to imagine how any filmmaker could convey this protagonist's situation, pitiful as it is, without a trace of humour. Writer/director Rowan Joffe has made the film as claustrophobic as BURIED (which Ryan Reynolds spends in an underground coffin) but without a trace of irony, or its own essential absurdity (which Christopher Nolan was able to infuse into the same situation in MEMENTO). Christine is well-kept in her disability; the characteristically dour Colin Firth plays Ben, who greets her in the morning, explains her situation, then goes off to work as a chemistry teacher, leaving Christine alone in an enormous modernist suburban manse somewhere near London; the characteristically helpful-but-menacing Mark Strong plays Dr. Nasch (his first name is a plot point too complex to explain here), who phones Christine as soon as Ben has left for work, coaches her in keeping a video diary, and takes her on outings (through a perpetually damp, rainy south England – the film has a pervasive late-November feeling) supposedly to help her regain her memory. Christine gradually starts to understand her plight, although the viewer simply becomes more and more confused. Christine spends most of her time alone in the house; outside it's always dim and rainy. There are breakdowns in dramatic logic: having uncovered a key fact about herself, Christine meets Ben at the door and while berating him, stands outside in a Niagara-volume downpour, ignoring Ben's requests that they move just a few meters to get inside. In another absurd scene, Christine is reunited with a beloved best friend, Clare. When Clare confesses a fleeting infidelity with Ben, Christine turns her back on her and leaves – although Clare offers her the only chance to have a social life beyond her present gloomy and mysterious life with the two gloomy and mysterious men who take turns mentoring/ manipulating her.Still, it is very much Kidman's show and she makes the best of it; as well she must, since she is at the centre of almost every scene. If you want to watch a virtuoso actor in a state of perpetual tension and distress, there is no one better than Kidman, though a superior film to do so would be THE OTHERS."
" Weak script short changes this mystery
",2017-08-15 00:00:00,6,"A different twist for a plot and some good acting should have made this a rousing mystery film. Unfortunately, ""Before I Go to Sleep"" gives a feel from the start that what we are seeing isn't quite real. So, we just wait until and as more and more details take shape and begin to make that clear. That results in a wholly different aspect of watching a mystery. Much of the suspense shifts to simply trying to guess or wait for the suspected misleading appearance to lead to the truth. The screenplay, directing and some technical aspects of the film seem off course. Otherwise, the acting is mostly quite good. Nicole Kidman is very good as Christine, but Colin Firth seems stiff as Ben. The R rating probably comes from some graphic scenes in flashbacks of beating and bloodshed. With a solid rewrite of the script and some better sets and solid direction, this might have been a very good mystery. As is, it's just fair."
" Slow moving, not really my type of film
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,4,"Slow moving. It took too long to get going before I got interested. I almost turned it off.Maybe I would have liked this more if I had not already binge watched other movies all day. It wasn't what I expected, but it was all right. Others may like it."
" Good Thriller...Until...
",2017-05-31 00:00:00,7,"Despite Nicole Kidman not being as likable as say a Jennifer Aniston would have been, this film is engaging, complex, and well put together. Colin Firth and Mark Strong's performances are outstanding. Kidman is annoying but her work is acceptable. In fact, Strong's work carries this film. As is often the case, if this movie had a Aniston, Jennifer Lawrence, or a Rachel McAdams type lead, it would have been amazing. That said, it is still a good film. Unfortunately, I would like to find out what happened to the last five minutes. Without giving any spoilers, those last few minutes were boring, drawn out (without reason), uneventful, and anti- climatic. I didn't read the book so perhaps this is one of those adaptation disasters wherein the book reads fine but when put on film, it goes off the rails. So much so, I was wondering what I missed because it was so bad.Overall, film is worth a watch and is good. I just wish those last few minutes hadn't left such a bad taste in my mouth."
" A strong cast that doesn't do much and a fragile script that collapses easily.
",2017-05-10 00:00:00,3,"This movie is a mystery thriller around a woman suffering from a rare amnesia condition due to a serious trauma and who, therefore, wakes up every day thinking she is twenty years old and not even remembering her marriage. The idea would be very interesting if it had been well developed by the script, but it didn't. As the film goes by, the villain becomes too obvious, as are the plot holes. One of the most obvious is the marriage of Christine (the name of the character, played by Nicole Kidman): if her condition of amnesia causes her to forget only the memories from a given moment of life forward, and if that moment happened when she was already married or, at least, the girlfriend of the one who would become her husband, how could she forget his face? This is just an example of a plot hole I discovered. I will not give more so I will not spoil the whole story. Kidman was OK but not amazing; Colin Firth starts slowly but improves with the film's advance; Mark Strong does a good supporting role but does not have room to do much."
" Good book adaption
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,8,"""Before I go to sleep"" is based on a book I read a few years ago but don't remember in detail. It tells the story of a middle-aged woman that wakes up next to a stranger and has to learn that after a terrible accident her memory gets lost every time she falls asleep. While the plot unravels and more characters join in, she has to find out whom to trust and how much of what her environment wants her to think is actually true.I couldn't see any grave mistakes ruining the movie. Of course the concept of lost memory is not entirely new, see movies like ""Memento"" or if you like a slapstick version ""50 first dates"" and many more. Nevertheless it is still an attractive one because it provides a plausible reason to keep the viewer in uncertainty about how trustworthy certain characters are. The acting is excellent in my opinion, the movie takes its topic serious and manages to create a thrilling atmosphere. Although not all of the false leads work out in the end and sometimes you can already guess something is fishy, they still work enough times to keep the pace and tension up.All in all there are many worse movies rated better. If you're looking for a thriller that keeps you guessing I'm sure you won't be disappointed. If you're looking for an Oscar movie, keep on looking."
" Well-paced but contains plot holes
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,6,"""Before I Go To Sleep"" is an interesting psychological thriller with an incredibly unbelievable story line. But, even if it may not work in some other movie, with other setting and actors, ""Before I Go To Sleep"" is a movie that can cope with this kind of events.*Spoilers* A woman (Christine, played by Nicole Kidman) wakes up next to a man (Ben, played by Colin Firth) she cannot recognize. When they start talking, he tells her that he is her husband. We find out that she had an ""accident"" and that she has a memory loss. Every time she wakes up in the morning, she forgets everything about the previous day. This sounds pretty crazy, but Nicole Kidman and Colin Firth keep us interested. We care about the story because of them and accept the premise of the story line. The pace of the events is fast, there are characters emerging from the past that keep us focused and we want to find out more. Being a thriller, this movie has accomplished its main goal and that is, keep the viewers agitated. However, the movie is far from being flawless. As some people have already mentioned in their reviews, some details seem very unconvincing. The married couple, Ben and Christine, have no friends, he is at work almost all the time and when he's not, he seems wicked and cunning, for no obvious reason at that time. She is in a state of confusion and partly depression but they still function ""normally""- they have cooked meals, their house is cleaned and organised, although they have no maids. The house is cold, modern and we're aware it costs a lot, but it is deprived of the personal touch. There are just some photos of Ben's and Christine's wedding day - there are dozens of them all over the place and they seem suspicious from the very beginning. From the very start of the film, the husband seems suspicious, so the ""unexpected"" twist at the end, when we find out that the perpetrator is actually her husband Ben, is not that unexpected. We actually see what we presumed we would see after the first 5-10 minutes of watching. The only thing that may be a bit surprising is that Ben is not her husband at all. He was just a lover who beat Christine and caused all that mess.My opinion: a film worth watching, but once is enough. And I'm not sure if the viewers will remember it in a months' time."
