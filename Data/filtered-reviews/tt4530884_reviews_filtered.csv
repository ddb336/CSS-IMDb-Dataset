" Man Haters Unite!
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,1,"Hang up your pink hat, put your 12 cats to bed and snuggle up to this feminazi, man hating extravaganza on a dateless Saturday night! Watch with glee as a bad man's penis head is bitten off and spit out like old bubble gum, as the rest of the member is split apart and torn from it's bad man's body by an angry vengeful psychotic woman. Yay! Fun!
See another poor fella anally raped with a 3 foot lead pipe as the blood soaked psychotic woman grunts with self satisfaction. I won't spoil any more for all the bitter, angry, psycho chicks out there that this garbage of a film was made for---you have to see for yourself what fun it is to violently sexually assault and murder men because they're all just so very bad!
I must warn you that the feelings this film evokes will make you want to ensure there's a fresh supply of batteries in the night stand Willie afterwards so you can pleasure yourself all night long while thinking back on this movie. Now what are you waiting for? Stop reading this review, throw on your ""Me Too"" shirt and give this a watch because it was specially made just for YOU! Then come back and give it 10 stars as the best movie EVER made in the history of cinema!!"
" Different in tone but still enjoyable
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,7,"Much of the hate and criticism comes from people who enjoyed the previous two films in the series and found this to be different. While this third film is different in tone, story wise it is still enjoyable.Found this to be far greater than the second film as this third film we are reunited back with Sarah Butler (but portraying a different character here), and there is given a backstory and more plot. This film isn't too much torture, rape or horror like the previous two which can see as to why people don't like it as much.However this was a good choice in making since it is different (different director), since the second film is too similar to the original. This film feels more realistic in comparison and isn't boring (like some of the reviews are saying).This film has more of a feel like a crime/detective/mystery type television series like a CSI as opposed to the previous two where those were more disturbing, very graphic and gory and were more like the Saw or Hostel films.There is still solid scenes of torture here but the story and characters are more of the focus. And it works."
" This film was more torture then jenifers victims
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,1,Only 1 star im afraid and thats for some of the dialogue was pretty much decent other then that i cant believe i wasted 2 hours of my time watching this. lets hope there isnt any more films after this.
" Unlike previous films, it strives for originality and difference.
",2020-10-10 00:00:00,7,"This is the second sequel to the 2010 film ""I Spit On Your Grave"", and it was, for me, the best of three films so far. Directed by R.D. Braunstein, it has managed to capture my attention like none. Without excessive nudity or sexual appeals, it's a film that makes us follow Jennifer on a journey of mad revenge.The story takes place a few years after the events experienced by Jennifer Hills. She has adopted a new name and lives in a new city, but she is advised by her therapist to attend a help group for rape victims where she meets Marla. With her guidance, she becomes a kind of avenger. However, Marla's death leads her to start acting alone and to attack and kill the men who have harmed other women she meets in the group.Finally, the series met a film that stands out for the difference! Here, basically, the victim becomes the aggressor. As she says at the end of the film, ""predators and preys"". It's how she sees the world, and she's not willing to be a prey again. The strength of the film is based on the good building of the characters and the way they capture our sympathy or disgust. The film also has a lot of good dialogues and material that makes us think about how women are treated, how justice and police work in such cases, how doing justice by own hands can be the right thing when legal ways fail... about that, this is the most intellectual, dramatic and reflective film in the series. The film also has several intense scenes and some graphic deaths that will please those who liked what was done in earlier films, as well as a single rape attempt, the only scene with some nudity as well. The ending is the hardest part to swallow because it gives the feeling that the protagonist has gone crazy.The cast is again led by Sarah Butler, who now has the time, space and material to show us her value as an actress. She is young but what she showed us here is enough to convince us that she has potential and can improve. Jennifer Landon gave life to a character with a strong personality and was happy in her work, as also Doug McKeon, who gave life to the father of a rape victim, the most tragic character in the film. Gabriel Hogan, Harley Jane Kozak, Michelle Hurd, Megan Raich and Christopher Hoffman also did a satisfying job on supporting characters.Technically, it's an average quality film that does what it promises and is happy in its effort. It makes regular use of cinematography, sets and costumes; action is there and it works; there are intense scenes with visual effects good enough to be credible. The editing work was well done and the pace is regular and pleasant. The soundtrack, although not brilliant, fulfills its role."
" Quite surprised
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,8,This wasn't the best movie ever but it was surprising to say the least. The main character returning in any franchise is always an eye opener and she plays it well. There should be one more sequel to Sarah's story and then call it quits
" Nice comeback from the last flop
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,9,"Number 1 was a decent film. Number 2 was one of the worst movies I've ever seen as far as credibility goes. In number 2, they put every rapist she was looking for right in front her just as though they were lined up backstage. It was so unbelievable how she tracked each one down with such ease.I wouldn't have given this film an afterthought but I was reading about the plot about how Jennifer attends group therapy, hears about the injustices that have been laid down on the poor victims in the group and eventually seeks justice (not really revenge although many deem this a revenge film). I also heard Sarah Butler was reprising her role and I thought she was terrific in number 1.The film also has an underlying message about just how broken the U.S. judicial system really is and that sometimes the only way justice can be served is if it's done cowboy style. Near the end of the film Jennifer let's this fact be known to detective McDylan as well as her therapist. The stories of how some of the rapists got off in the film are stories we've all unfortunately heard in the real news for way too long now.Overall I enjoyed the movie and its pacing as well as its very credible plot."
" Best movie
",2020-04-24 00:00:00,10,"This is one of the best movie I have seen, I love all 3 of them"
" Gore a plenty but other then that nothing else of substance
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,2,"Not really a movie I'd watch on my own but decided to with my fianc√©. Hated this movie completely and only reason I gave any stars at all were for the violent scenes even though there was very few.First of all main character you feel mixed rooting for. On one end she was violently raped and you feel sorry for, on the other end shes incredibly obnoxious and wildly insane. While I do agree with vengeance towards men who have done unspeakable crimes. The lead automatically throws all men in one category and it becomes prejudice after awhile.Second this movie relies to heavy on showing scenes that in real time look like there happening but turn out to be not real. I understand director is trying to let you in on how sick this womens mind is but after awhile it happens so often you cant determine whats fake and whats reality.Third just felt this movie was very draggy overall. You actually skip solid 30 minutes in to this movie and basically miss nothing. On top of it scenes were very repeating and basically in same location every time Im assuming that was because movie was on tight budget.Overall I just can't recommend this movie at all unless you're someone whos just heavily into gore and looking to watch something like that because this movie lacks everything else."
" Bad portrayal
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,3,"I watched this one having really liked the first remake, as sadistic as it sounds, when things like this actually happen all the time it's nice to see a woman get revenge, so I thought a film about her getting revenge for others would be equally as satisfying.
Unfortunately I was wrong, while the deaths are good, they made the main character just look unhinged. Rape is a trauma you never really get over but the last ten minutes were just stupid, as if the film makers were trying to say that rape victims just turn into psychopaths who want to kill anyone and everyone, and that portrayal is just uncomfortable and upsetting, plus the leader of the group clearly hadn't a clue how to deal with victims and that made the group session scenes frustrating as hell. Very disappointed"
" Worst film i've seen in a long time
",2020-03-11 00:00:00,1,In contrary to the first two movies this movie was just a joke. You just have to develop a hatred against the protagonist because she just acts irrational and like a wanna be psychpath. In the first movies I felt empathy by watching the woman taking revenge but in this film I just thought her behaviour was dump and childish. Don't watch this film - it'll feed your anger in relation to feminism and the victimhood of woman.
" Not as straightforward as I and II, but still powerful
",2020-02-07 00:00:00,8,"If you loved I Spit On Your Grave one and two then there is every chance you will love this. It is not a rehash of the same story however, with the character from the first movie moving into new territory and advancing her skills to help others. If you are after a straight revenge movie then this one is probably not so satisfying, despite the subtitle. It is powerful however, and it's a delight to watch a person become braver and more determined the more life throws her curveballs. This movie could perhaps be compared to The Brave One (2007). I Spit On Your Grave III represents an intelligent evolution from the earlier movies."
" direct sequel
",2020-01-08 00:00:00,5,"Jennifer Hills (Sarah Butler) is still haunted by her rape and is living under the new name Angela. She has a therapist and attends a support group. She fantasizes about vigilante violence. When a friend in the group is murdered, she turns into a real vigilante.This is a direct sequel to the first movie. It's a continuation of the story rather than a repeat. It's more akin to Death Wish. This works to that extend. There isn't much else. The cops are heartless idiots. The world is full of lecherous males. Even when they aren't, she says that they are. I do appreciate a direct sequel but it's the least imaginative way forward. There is limited tension and limited story advancement."
" Another director takes over the franchise and totally breaks the vibe.
",2019-12-18 00:00:00,5,"Compared to the remake (10/10) and the follow up (8/10) both directed by Steven R. Monroe, this is looks like and is, a desperate cash in! Lacks any real suspense or tension but this is what always happens with any series, that goes on and on. No directive quality or any substance in '3'. Hopefully '4' is a return to form. The only plus point, is it stars the original Sarah Butler."
" Descent into Debauchery
",2019-09-08 00:00:00,2,"I Spit on Your Grave 3
Third times is not a charm
In I Spit on Your Grave 3, ISOYG picks up with Angela (Jennifer Hills) in recovery trying to adjust after her trauma. In this movie the rhetoric and man hating gets ratchetted up. Early on Angela teams up with a fellow therapy team member and engage in some street justice and intimidation of sex predators. When Marla is raped and killed, it sends Angela, who already has issues, over the edge.
Just like in its predecessor movies, there are more male assholes. The man at the bus stop checking out her ass, the serial date seeking co-worker, the park thugs and the old asshole at the bar, to name a few.
ISOYG3 has greater depth as the storyline explores rape counseling, and the feelings of trapped women the suffering of other types of people who are survivors of rape and the powerlessness of victims and ineptness of the criminal justice system.
The movie moves from Angela's flashbacks of revenge killing, to fantasy killing during confrontational situations to the flat-out entrapment and predatory killing of Marla's ex-boyfriend. There is more humiliation and wetting of pants, stun gunning, rectal violation with pipes and of course, the cutting off of male genitals.
As Angela moves from victim to predator, her character becomes more pathological as she seeks more and more vengeance. During this process, it now becomes difficult to continue to sympathize with Angela as other people in her therapy group are now under suspicion for two of the murders which she committed, and which she accused other for her deeds. Despite this, her revenge killing continues.
Ultimately, the police home in on Angela and learn here true identity, Jennifer Hills, and now Angela is the main suspect in multiple revenge killings. This issue is not resolved but we find out towards the end of the movie that Angela was incarcerated for two years and it appears that her discussions with her therapist were while she was in a correctional or psychiatric facility. Though she's getting out, it is clear that she still has homicidal visions or fantasies. Though the movie has more depth, any sense of sympathy that she had gained was lost. Now it would appear that she is simply a psychotic killer.
At this point, the genre has descended into such debauchery as to lose its initial message, that you hope that they don't make any more."
" It isn't that thrill ride we're used to from previous parts
",2019-08-26 00:00:00,7,"After the second part focused on entirely different characters, Sarah Butler is back for the third part, ""I Spit on Your Grave: Vengeance is Mine"", to reprise her role as 'Jennifer Hills'. She had changed her name to 'Angela' though, and we pretty much see the aftermath of the events that took place in the first film. Of course just of the remake and not the first first one. Directed by R.D. Braunstein, with whose work I am not familiar with at all aside from this film here, I must say that I enjoyed this one as well. It is nowhere close to be as good as the first part, but here is some genuine character development to be found. Not only with 'Jennifer' but also with 'Marla' (Jennifer Landon) and 'Oscar' (Doug McKeon), whose character I absolutely loved and it is great he was included in this film. It gave it so much more depth. To amp up the gore, this film uses many fake outs though. Meaning, that you actually get a decent amount of cool bloody shots, but most of them turn out to be just in 'Jennifer's head. Like in an -what if- scenario. It kind of shows that mental state she is in at this point, but sometimes it feels, like there were scenes only included for the sake of having them in them. The last one we get to see, for example, makes no sense. Usually this film went for it in an understandable way. Someone says something offending to her, she bludgeons them as a response, then we cut back to reality and she walks away without having harmed anyone. As if these scenes showed her desire of what she'd love to do in that moment. in the end you see her getting attacked by two fellow prison inmates, which she deals with in the usual violent fashion. Then the therapist shows up to stop her and she just turns around and still on an adrenaline rush 'Jennifer' takes her out, too. And it was a fake out again. She walks away, not covered in blood... nothing actually happened. But she wasn't reacting to anything in that moment. So what? Does she now randomly fantasize -what if- scenarios? Becoming totally mental? I think, this scene hurt the movie actually a little, because it will not just leave me confused. But makes for a good start to theorize the hell out of it, just as I did after I watched it with my wife. It's cool when movies make you wanna talk about them afterwards. For a third part this was good, but nothing all too special. ""I Spit on Your Grave: Vengeance is Mine"" has some really good moments, especially when it comes to the character build stuff. But it isn't that thrill ride we're used to from previous parts."
" Charlene Bronson Spits on Your Grave! And worse...
",2019-05-29 00:00:00,7,"The starting point of this ""I Spit on your Grave 3: Vengeance is Mine"" is definitely interesting and courageous, and also quite unusual for a film of its type. Usually only TV-dramas focus on the mental & physical struggles of recovering rape victims. The plot picks up the lead girl of the original film (the original 2010 remake, that is) and elaborates on the fact that, several years after the traumatic experiences, she still hasn't been able to put her life back on track. Jennifer changed her name to Angela, she lives in a modest big-city apartment, goes to her desk clerk job every day and follows therapy sessions. But she still suffers from nasty flashbacks of her vicious gang-rape and avoids social contact with practically everybody, and especially men because she sees potential rapists in all of them. Angela then joins a support group with people who experienced similar traumas, and this finally seems to help her! Not because the sessions are so inspiring, but because she becomes friends with the eccentric daredevil Marla. Her idea of processing traumas is by extracting vengeance against random male chauvinist pigs, and she drags Angela on board. When Marla doesn't return after an encounter with her violent ex, Angela snaps entirely and goes on a vigilante killing spree that would even put Charles Bronson to shame!Let me first come back to something I mentioned earlier, regarding the starting point of ""Vengeance is Mine"". Practically since the beginning of cinema, the horror genre has always been accused of being women-unfriendly or even downright misogynistic, and often righteously so. The least you can say about this film is that it attempts to turn the tables around. All male characters are either perverted pigs or pathetic wimps, whereas the females are forceful, intelligent and tough. That's a statement if there ever was one! And even though, technically speaking, Jennifer/Angela isn't a victim herself this time around, there still isn't a jury-member among the audience that will convict her (quote the tagline of the 1978 milestone), because all her targets are loathsome scum that deserve what's coming to them.There naturally are a few defaults in the script as well. During the entire first act, and even in the first scenes where she joins Marla at night, Jennifer/Angela is exclusively portrayed as a sensitive and terrified victim, and the plot conveniently ignores that she already had her share of merciless and bloodied vengeance in the first film. Her flashbacks only replay the agonies she suffered, but ignore that she also tortured and killer her assailants in imaginative ways that would even make the Jigsaw-killer bow with respect! The bizarre and implausible climax is also a letdown, but at least it keeps the options open for more gratuitously violent sequels! Last but not least, albeit less gruesome than the previous two installments (and the '78 role-model), you can always count on the ""I Spit on your Grave"" franchise for some footage that literally makes every male spectator squirm on their seat and cover their family jewels for protection. Notably the castration/penile mutilation sequence and an excruciatingly painful moment involving a metal pipe and a sledgehammer are guaranteed to make you squeal like a you-know-what!"
" inappropriate!
",2019-05-16 00:00:00,1,"It's really strange to me how every single part of the three dirty and inhumane films won several honored awards !!!!! I'm sorry for you ... Just Not look at the movie ,it's very bad."
" An Honest Review
",2019-05-06 00:00:00,1,"So Sarah Butler came back and that was pretty cool to do a follow up...but it almost makes Jennifer Hills into the bad guy and, though it was unsettling, it doesn't seem right. She's a little too pro-active on the vengeance thing to really sit well.It kind of works as a continuation of a story...but it kills a lot of the overwhelming sympathy you had for Jennifer, even while she was extracting some brutal vengeance. And I kind of feel that the point of movies like this is to get the audience to sympathize with someone doing some absolutely horrible things."
" Dexter Morgan as a woman
",2019-04-08 00:00:00,7,"This is by far the best film of the ""I Spit on Your Grave"" series and the only one I could probably recommend. It is not a good movie per se but if you want to see a decent ""rape and revenge movie"" you are not really at the best address with these movies because the movies show a lot of rape but little content have to offer and film technically on an inferior level.
Finally, we have a real movie with a consistent story, subplots, different characters, and a real arc, but unfortunately, it's not a perfect movie, or one hundred percent well thought out.In this movie that's not the case, not only do we get a proper story for the first time, we have a decent sequel that actually tells a story and does not take ""name only sequel"" and what I like best is the story told in such detail Flashbacks by film montage, etc. that you can actually only watch this movie without having to see the other films.Anyone who has a problem with blood should not touch it and who has even more problems with bone fractures crushed limbs or genitals is clearly at the wrong address because the word ""vigilanti"" and ""violence"" are very capitalized here with a decent sized one V.Only, in the last third the film lacks a bit and the story do not really know what to do because the motivation of the main characters drifts more and more sideways, but perhaps that was intended to symbolize the uncertainty and despair.Just watch this movie and share the others' hands you do not miss anyway and get more than half of the other movies explained anyway in this movieI honestly like the movie I like it I can hardly recommend it to anyone, but I warn you to watch the movie on a full stomach"
" 3rd is the best by far. Everyone else 'Your Wrong'.
",2019-04-03 00:00:00,10,"I loved it! I dont know what everyone else has been watching but ive watched it twice & think its excellent, the best one yet"
" A true sequel, much better than I Spit on Your Grave 2
",2019-03-31 00:00:00,7,"I Spit on Your Grave 3 is a direct follow up to the first movie, ignoring I Spit on Your Grave 2 entirely. It is much better off for it. Where the second movie was just the same plot, but with a worse story, worse effects and MUCH worse acting, this third movie goes in a different direction. Instead of dealing with the direct result of an assault, the main character is now dealing with the effects on her life re-integrating into society.Jennifer Hills (Sarah Butler) has taken up a new name (Angela) and a new life, but is still haunted by the events of the first movie, when she suffered a violent assault and gang rape. She joins a survivors group, where she meets Marla, who has extreme views on how perpetrators should be treated. After Marla's death, Angela picks up where she left off, as an avenging angel.This change of pace works well for the character and the franchise. The gore is toned down some, but is made up for with story. Not that anything is top notch caliber. but coming off the last movie in the series, it seems 10X better."
" Jennifer Hills is Back to Dish Out More Vengeance!!!
",2019-03-06 00:00:00,6,"This one was okay. It was different because nobody gets attacked, but Jennifer, (Who changed her name to Angela) is going around the city getting revenge for others who have been attacked and violated. She joins a group counsel and makes friends with Marla. Jennifer and Marla start hanging out and even threaten the step dad to one of the girls in the group who is being assaulted him.Soon after, Marla is killed and she receives no justice, so Jennifer goes around torturing and killing anyone who was involved and rapists who try to put the moves on her. Like I said, I didn't like this one as well. I thought the 2nd one was better, even though it was about a different woman. If you like the series and wanna complete the trilogy, you might like I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE III: VENGEANCE IS MINE!!!"
" Poor sequel.
",2019-03-04 00:00:00,4,"Like it or loath it, the very original I Spit on Your Grave was a shocking and powerful movie. The 2010 remake, although somewhat over the top in the revenge department, was good. Part 2, nothing to do with it's predecessor, was also quite good. Part 3 picks up from the 2010 film with Sarah Butler reprising her role. This is the best thing about part 3, she plays her part well and looks good doing so. The thin plot has her day dreaming about commiting murders and actually committing them (I think!). The ending is not great and it left me feeling somewhat disappointed. Sure, the killings are brutal and bloody but there are many far better movies out there for that. Really quite a needless sequel. It lacks the amount of sexual violence of the previous movies and consequently is the only I Spit to be passed uncut in Britain by the BBFC."
" These ""I Spit On Your Grave"" Movies Keep Getting Better
",2019-02-10 00:00:00,8,"02/09/2019 I'm starting to ""align myself with"" this really enjoyable subculture series of revenge unthwarted movies. No boundaries, no person is excluded for good fun killing revenge. I could easily substitute the movies victims with my own, my favorites, who from my point of view are much more deserving. The series seems to be getting better, better quality of content, better acting, more fun to watch. Immerse yourself, no one will know that you too are an ""Armchair Killer"". After all, who wouldn't enjoy killing their very bestest, most deserving enemies, at least in fantasy if not reality? I know that I'd love it and do. Maybe??? .. even the reality would be fun? Good fun movie, seems to be getting better. Bon Appetit"

" let's get more women sadists on screen
",2018-10-17 00:00:00,1,"Women's violence is so natural, right?
let's part IV"
" Horrible to the 12th power
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,1,"Where do I begin? Jennifer should have never been brought back. Se looked a mess in this film, and the need to have blood on her. I don't see how there can be a part 4 with part 3 being god-awful. Nothing in this movie is good, the directing, the storyline, the actors, the camera angles, the dialogue, the childish behavior of Jennifer and her friend. How is she having ""ptsd"" or trauma if she has n problem walking the streets at night by herself all of the time. No one with that amount of trauma would be stalking calmly either; they would be staying away. This is probably another writer with no experience, read some stuff on Wikipedia and started writing, with no regards for logic. Jennifer was so annoying in this one. Could have been a new direction altogether with this movie, as in never happened."
" In a perfect world it would be the other way around...
",2018-08-15 00:00:00,10,"Let me start off by saying the original I Spit on Your Grave (initially titled Day of the Woman, as far as I know) it's controversial, but not because of the subject matter. Last House on the Left pretty much started the market for that and, before that, there was I Drink Your Blood, in which Jerry Gross was involved as much as he was with Meir Zarchi's film. I believe the controversy spans from the hype created by ""professional"" reviewers like Roger Ebert and the marketing strategies employed by Gross himself. Audiences had a picture on their minds already, which in most cases is far worse than anything displayed on the screen. From there on, it was a matter of outdoing whatever was done before in terms of graphic sexual elements and violence. The Italian film industry did a great job at that with the same classic story line Wes Craven slightly modified from Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring. I saw a totally different movie from what Ebert or most people saw in 1978's I Spit... It stroke me as a serious, hyper realistic, minimalist and even uncomfortably lyrical piece. The much talked about record- setting gang rape sequence, as long as it seems to be for most people who vilify this film, is such a large chunk of it because, as opposed to the two first spin offs, it focuses on the physical suffering and moral degradation of the victim. Compared to the remake and its sequel and as brutal as it is, there's no magnifying of the sadistic element through verbal exchange and games or anything else. It's a vile act because there's nothing else to call it and no need to revel on it. The second half seems rushed and unsatisfying because, 1. The market Mr. Gross aimed at would want more brutality and 2. Most of all, the real point, as it came across me, was her moral dilemma and the victim's method, which was to lure the aggressors and, most likely, the audiences into believing she was some kind of masochist. I'll even go as far as to say that the impact, besides the subject matter, was mainly achieved through genuine tension build up and even a few jump scares, much like the good horror films from the era. That being said, I think in a perfect world you would say that I Spit on Your Grave 2010 exists only as background for Vengance is Mine (which for starters, being a quote from the Bible, makes for an intriguing title) and that part 2 has no legitimate reason to exist. In reality, is the other way around. Part 1, which whatever one may call it is not hyper realistic as the original, but all the contrary, exists because of the big audience there is for the so called ""torture porn"" genre. Therefore, Part 2 exists only because ""fans"" of the first one wanted a second serving of the same (which, in all honesty, lacks the creativity of the avenging schemes and devices and the little credibility part one had to it), even though there's no connection to the ""original"" and, part three, straying almost completely from Craven's basic formula and leaning more towards Ms. 45 or Death Wish's, is aimed at the wrong audience and, therefore, doesn't really have a reason to exist. Therefore, except for a couple of all too brief graphic scenes which consist mostly of Jennifer's fantasizing, this film doesn't really have anything to offer to audiences of the first two. The dialogue, which is a whole lot more copious, consists more on philosophical ""diatribes"" on justice, forgiveness and human nature than the ""take back what you said"" dynamics of the rest of the franchise. There are more characters to follow than just Jennifer and more development to them and the settings seem more likely for a rape victim than those in the former entries, too. Most of all, the overall moral of the film is a whole lot bleaker: While it's true that violence is the most contagious of diseases and creates a seemingly never ending cycle, and despite how vacuous the idea of justice may seem as it is practiced the ""right"" way, it only gets worse and worse... I particularly liked Doug McKeon's character (whose name is deliberately mispronounced by a law enforcement agent on several occasions) a lot. It offered a radically different perspective on the issue, and it's not the only one. In that respect, Marla was also pretty remarkable. If this film borrows from any other movies, besides the ""vigilante"" ones, is the original Last House on the Left, Eye for an Eye, the Accused and even Taxi Driver. Overall, I see why most fans of the franchise hated it and it's no wonder. It's a similar case as Robocop 2 or The Empire Strikes Back, not being directed by the same guy and not keeping up with the ""trademarks"" of the ""saga."" It's too serious for its own good....."
" 6 from 10

Disappointing!"
" JUSTICE ISN'T SOMETHING FOR YOU, IT'S SOMETHING YOU DISH OUT
",2018-04-19 00:00:00,6,"There is nothing like a good rape/revenge film or so it seems since we are on number 3. Jennifer/Angela (Sarah Butler) is now in group where she befriends Marla (Jennifer Landon) an over the top woman who had all the best lines. At this point it becomes a fun ""Lila and Eve"" as they form a little vigilante group.The film contained flashbacks from part 2 in case you forgot what a gang rape looked like. Marla was a great character, Angela wore thin without her. Gabriel Hogan played the detective and was Crispin Glover creepy in the role, perhaps by design as nearly all the men were like that except for Oscar (Doug McKeon) who was part of the group. The film started out great and would have been far better if they had kept their only good character in it longer.Guide: F-bomb, bloody violence, brief rape scenes, brief nudity in film flashback."
" I Spit On Your Grave 3 cuts through the familiar formula only for it to become bloody boring blandness.
",2018-03-08 00:00:00,3,"It's a sequel people, a continuation from the first controversial instalment that had viewers looking away from screens due to the sheer amount of blood, torture and obscenity. After the previous chapter, which felt all too familiar, they changed things up slightly. Following from the events of the first film, Jennifer ditches her career aspirations to become an assault hotline operator and attend group counselling sessions in order to heal her scarring experience. She develops a bond with a girl who is then mysteriously murdered. What does Jennifer do? She lures and traps these unpunished rapists/murderers and kills them in the only way possible...brutally. Stab a neck, slice a man's ""Crown Jewels"" (only way I could think of politely describing it) in half and even shoving a huge pipe and hammering it up someone's...well, you get the idea. That's all well and good if you have a sadistic mind, but I'm afraid that's only 7 minutes of the film. The remaining 84 minutes are bad. Just plain bad. Firstly, I actually found this film to be the most distasteful. Not because of the vivid torture scenes, which actually are few and far between in this chapter, but due to the depiction of men. Apparently we are all rapists and only live to have sex because it's the only thing we think about constantly. Nearly every male character is depicted to be disgusting, and it's offensively unrealistic. Clearly aiming for a female empowerment thriller, yet it misses and then some due to the horrendous one sided perspective. The screenplay isn't intelligent enough to make us sympathise with Jennifer, so it's just watching a woman kill men with a minimal amount of psychological analysis of her mental stability. She becomes disillusioned with society, unable to differentiate between well-meaning men and sexual predators. But the boring plot and unexciting dialogue never fully explores this. The acting was mediocre also. For a film that breaks its own formula, it feels more familiar than ever."
" Spoilers follow ...
",2017-12-23 00:00:00,8,"The 2010 remake of the original 1978 rape-revenge film has so far spawned two sequels. The first deals with a similar storyline with new characters, whilst this returns to the original victim Jennifer Hills (played by Sarah Butler). Now, several years on from her original appalling ordeal, she is calling herself Angela Ditrenka, is receiving therapy and still having fantasies about killing anyone who shows sexual interest in her. And for a while, such interest borders almost on overkill. Everywhere she goes, she is fondled, leered at, and subject to coarse and intimidating abuse.And yet, the way in which writer Daniel Gilboy chooses to continue Jennifer's story is to have her confront her relentless (and understandable) disappointment in so-called justice, is to carry out revenge attacks on men who rape other people. To this end, she attends a fairly useless victim support group; on hearing of others' tragic circumstances, she takes revenge on their behalf. The problem with this approach is that, whereas in the first two films, we see the antagonists perpetuate their horrific acts and are therefore eager to have retribution inflicted upon them; in this film, we only hear about their felonies. Therefore, when Hills adopts the familiar theme of dressing up to ensnare the perpetrators and kill them, the structure of the story doesn't fuel quite so strongly our eagerness to see grisly revenge carried out.And yet, this slight misgiving is balanced out by the fact that the story is very good, and well told and acted. Butler is entirely convincing in a very intense role, and she is supported by a mainly very talented cast. There are enough twists and moments of gut-wrenching gore (although pretty brief) to keep things gruesomely entertaining throughout. The structure of the telling is very involving too, with us being led to believe one thing when another is actually the case.It would seem this is the final entry into the franchise. Other than starting again, I'm not sure how Hills' story can continue. I really enjoyed this and was kept guessing throughout. Delightfully, all the twists in the narrative are carefully hinted at all the way along - no matter how far-fetched certain moments may appear, they all make complete sense.I'm surprised this hasn't garnered more positive online reviews. Sadly, there are unhappy views presented so passionately that 'anyone giving this a 9 or 10 must be involved in the movie making as it is really poor (sic)'. It goes without saying that that expressed sentiment is untrue and simply displays those reviewers' precocious view that no-one is allowed to disagree with them."
" Sarah Butler is the best thing about this movie.
",2017-10-21 00:00:00,3,"Let me just get right to it. I'm not a huge fan of this series, this and the first are the only ones I've seen.But I'll be honest, I was only seeing this for Sarah Butler. This one was sort of better than the first,she's kind of like a vigilante which is kinda cool,but they could of put some action scenesin kinda like Death Wish. I mean I guess I could say some of the death scenes of her victims where alright. At least Sarah was fun to watch, speaking of fun to watch, she was super sexy in that red dress let me tell ya.Overall, I guess a could watch this again, like on a rainy day if I have nothing else to watch.I give it a 3/10. For me, it's just alright but I like Sarah Butler, and she's the only reason I would watch this again."
" Mindless and hate-filled
",2017-06-21 00:00:00,3,"I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE 3: VENGEANCE IS MINE is another mindless hate-filled addition to the series, barely any different to the two films which preceded it. Okay, the formula is slightly different this time around, as the main character isn't raped at the outset, but the grisly revenge killings are, while the self-help circle material is frankly a bit dull. The problems with this film are myriad, but the weak writing is the foremost issue, with one-dimensional characters and tepid pacing throughout.For the sadists among us, there are some very graphic and nasty death scenes here, meted out to men who are more than deserving of their fate. Even so, this ventures into torture porn territory and would be quite disturbing if the CGI effects weren't so terrible. Elsewhere, lukewarm, occasionally histrionic acting also mars the experience, along with a cast filled with unlikeable characters, leaving this a sadistic chore for only the most hardened gore-seekers."
" One of the worse movies ever
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,3,"Really dull and nothing like the other two that were already worse than the original and classic version. Second tire actors and poorly-written dialogues. If you like trash, then you will have a great time watching this one. It is hard to believe that producers and the director managed to make something that bad. The plot - if I can say there is a plot - is nothing but confusing. The victim seems to be a twisted freak. Rape has been gaining momentum in many cultures and this is important to help stopping violence against women. Even some well know schools have a problem managing this but this movie will not help at all. It is pure trash covered in some attempt to make justice. So, enjoy your banana split and forget the rest."
" OTT this time
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,4,"I really liked both 1 and 2 of Steve R. Monroe's I Spit On Your Grave movies, but this third installment directed by R.D. Braunstein turned into a bit of a joke.Years after her abuse Jennifer Hills (Sarah Buter) is is trying to get on with her life with the help of a psychiatrist and a support group. Not sleeping, daydreaming and hating life, Jennifer soon meets Marla (Jennifer Landon) who's ""stuff the world"" attitude and positive outlook on justice soon helps Jennifer with her own outlook on life. The pair become BFF's and begin dishing out their own form of justice. When something happens to Marla, Jennifer seems to lose the plot and go it alone in a sadistic, I-now-love-killing manner.In I Spit on Your Grave: Vengeance is Mine it lost the difficulty of abuse and the brutality of it that the previous movies had. It became more Saw than sad.If you liked the first two you probably won't like this much, but if you hated the first two, this attempt might be right up your ally."
