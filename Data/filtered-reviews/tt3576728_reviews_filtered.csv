" A story cut short and soulless!
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,5,Beginning was ok but lacks build up to the climax of the scene which was the torching. No mentioning of the religion or the nature of it's God or messenger. And dealing with it as a slave traders seeking control of the market. The movie tried to make the character with no transition from life as a slave and beyond. Ignored major milestones that changed and grow his character. Ignored other slaves side stores. Uncleared and confusing.
" Mediocre at Best
",2021-01-15 00:00:00,5,"I watched this with an open mind, not having read any reviews, and not having previously heard of it.Inspired by 'true events' I found the story to be very bland. I'm not quite sure what the writers, director etc. were aiming for, but clearly they missed the mark. If the story is about religion then this should have featured a little more strongly and obviously in the story telling, instead this film ended up with a dilute version that seems to shy away from any explicit mention of Islam. The message of hope, courage, overcoming oppression and gaining equality could be applied to any number of religions and 'heroes', and has been with far better effect. Perhaps the propaganda machine got in the way trying to give a softening edge to Islam, in the hope that it would woo Western viewers? Whatever the reason it was to the detriment to the somewhat muddled storyline (beginning and end but what happened in the middle?).The majority of the animation was reasonable but had the feel of a trailer for a new Playstation or XBox game. I kept waiting for the words 'Not actual gameplay' to be displayed at the bottom. There were some beautifully rendered animation features for the hawks and horses, although for the latter quality did slip when in 'group' situations. Fight scenes were well rendered but not outstanding and had no originality.I'm not sure that the voice stars were actually a good match to the characters. I recognised Ian McShane without having to refer to a cast list. Perhaps it was the poor script and film direction but the characters appeared and sounded wooden and without any dimension. The film started well but quickly deteriorated to the basic good guys and bad guys with no real character building, resulting in very little viewer empathy.Musical score was easily forgettable, and I have, so no review possible.Having watched this once I wouldn't consider a repeat viewing. Boredom has it's limits."
" great movie
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,10,The movie is great. But don't be shy to mention Islam.
" WE ABSOLUTELY NEEDED A BRAND NEW HERO in 2020!!
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,9,"BILAL WAS DEFINITELY A NEW BREED OF ANIMATED MOVIE FOR PEOPLE OF ALL AGES AND ORIGINS TO ENJOY. THAT SAID, WITHOUT SPOILING THE PLOT FOR ANYONE - THIS WAS A VERY SATISFYING TRUE STORY OF COURAGE, PERSEVERANCE, BRAVERY, FAITH, LOVE OF SELF AND OF THINE FAMILY. I VIEWED THIS MOVIE IN THE US ON THE STARZ NETWORK AND I CONSIDER MYSELF LUCKY TO HAVE SEEN IT. IT TOOK FOREVER TO GET FINANCING NEEDED TO SEE THIS ANIMATED FILM IN THE WEST, OUTSIDE OF THE ""CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION."" IT SHOWS GREAT DIGITAL CINEMATOGRAPHY AND PROMISES A ROLLER COASTER OF A PLOT. THIS PLOT IS MOSTLY ASSOCIATED WITH BILAL, A YOUNG AFRICAN SLAVE BOY/TEEN WITH DREAMS AS BIG AS THE CONTINENT ITSELF. THOSE DREAMS GIVE FUEL TO BILAL, TO GO FROM A DARK SLAVE EXISTENCE, TO THAT OF A HEROIC WARRIOR, THAT WOULD MAKE HIS STORY ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL STORIES IN ALL OF MECCA. A STORY SO POWERFUL THAT HIS HEROIC TALES ARE STILL BEING PASSED ON TO OTHERS BY BOTH WRITTEN AND ORAL TRADITIONS, USUALLY IN THE ARABIC RELIGIOUS CONTEXT. CHECK THIS FILM OUT, ENJOY IT IMMENSELY AND PLEASE BE PURPOSEFUL IN SHARING THIS FIND WITH OTHERS!PERHAPS, AFTER SEEING THE SUCCESS OF THIS FILM, WE WILL BE SEEING FAR MORE LIKE THIS ONE, IN THE YEARS TO COME. EVEN PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THE US WOULD LOVE TO SEE MORE HISTORIC FILMS SUCH AS THIS ONE. IT BRODENED MY KNOWLEDGE SO MUCH. THANK YOU TO THE CREW, PRODUCERS AND THE CAST."
" Bilal
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,10,One of the Best Animated movie i have ever watched .
" One of the best animated movie in my 25 years!
",2020-12-18 00:00:00,10,"At first I thought it was made by hollywood or dreamwork (like joseph and moses) but in the middle part of the storyline it was kinda unimaginable if the US the one who made this (you know what I mean). Anyway I really, highly, distinguishedly, respect this movie a lot! There should have been more movies like this! Especially about remarkable and notable prominent leader who leads this world into justice and faith."
" Outstanding Animation Film! Best Storyline, best CGI, best screen script! This film deserves an Oscar.
",2020-11-26 00:00:00,10,"Must Watch Movie!!!!!
One of the most interesting aspects of movie reviewing is looking behind the screen at the provenance of a project, and with Dubai's first ever CGI animation, BILAL, the story behind this 1400-year-old animation saga is truly gripping. Cannes 69th Film Festival is the perfect venue for this, where it will screen shortly. The cast includes excellent actors Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (who played the yacht assassination target for Matt Damon in BOURNE IDENTITY), and Ian McShane from HBO's ""Game of Thrones"" TV series, also PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN.Eponymous main character Bilal is actually based on a historic figure, a revered warrior, named Bilal bin Rabah. And who was he? ""One of the most trusted companions of the Prophet Mohammed,"" according to exhaustive research done by the film's makers via Saudi-informed ""forensic historians."" What makes this film interesting is that you don't necessarily have to know the backstory to appreciate the master-level craftsmanship on the CGI in BILAL. In fact, this project pays off the promise that 'reality begins at 30 million polygons' as coined by animation forefather Alvy Ray Smith, and really brings home the notion that this technology now has a life of its own as this fantastic tool available all over the world for people to tell make epic explorations.When you watch this film, you see top drawer animation with a sincere message of ""faith, hope and self-discovery inspired by the real life story,"" as described by the filmmakers.American actor Jacob Latimore is teenage BILAL. According to Kidzworld, a portal for young actors, this Milwaukee native grew up with a love of Motown and singular gifts as a musician early on with a hit called ""Superstar."" Which means he has the perfect voice control as a voice actor, not to mention his credits include roles in 2014's RIDE ALONG (Kevin Hart, Ice Cube) and THE MAZE RUNNER, as well as a 2010 credit for VANISHING ON 7TH STREET. Over the course of this spirited and engaging film, Bilal's character will age from 6 to 60 years old, and the intricate animation's high-dollar production values make it a pleasure to sit through.This is a multi-talent collaboration, as mentioned, with clever choices such as Atil Örvarsson, an Icelandic composer, to did the music. Örvarsson said he tried to ""combine the archaelogical, historical nature of the story and make it accessible for an international audience. We used old instruments from the region and combined it with modern electronically synthesised music, we created themes for some of the characters and created a unique, other worldly sound for the witch doctor."" Project point-person Jamal nailed the complexity of producing a movie of this scope in CGI, especially when the Dubai creative climate is more familiar with shorter projects. ""The industry here is based on short movies and originally we wanted to work with an animation studio but we found there was no animation or CGI studio in the MENA region so we had to start the studio ourselves to make BILAL and that's how we established Dubai-based Barajoun Studios."" The film itself was funded by individual investors from the Gulf Region, including Saudi Arabia with the Doha Film Institute. Expect BILAL to be on the radar this year, as Variety, Indiewire, Cartoon Brew, and Animation News have all tracked its progress thus far. Let's hope this film has the harmonizing effect as intended, because the animation is truly pixel-perfect. BILAL will screen this week at Cannes 69th International Film Festival, see schedule here for details."
" Strange decisions make this a strange mainstream movie
",2020-10-06 00:00:00,6,"Wow, I was completely unaware of the ""popularity"" this movie had. I love coming here and reading reviews where every other review is either a 1 or a 10! 1, 10, 1, 10, 2, 9. I watched this movie having only the knowledge of its title and IMDB rating, which is still very high (7.9) by the time I'm writing this, so I will try and give this an unbiased point of view. I also had no idea that Bilal was a religious figure, and that was a good thing as I generally hate religious movies so I went in with an open mind. I really liked the direction of the movie, really well shot scenes and very dynamic action scenes. One particularly long battle is probably the highlight of the movie as it rivals with any mainstream blockbuster. The problem was that the animation could have been better, it was not a disaster, mind you, but not up to the standards set by other studios or by the ambition of the direction. The story, on the other hand, was a bit of a mess. Again, I didn't know anything about Bilal, but many times it had the vibe of a religious propaganda movie, only it never went there which was very strange. After doing some research I found out he was a very important Islamic figure and it baffles me that they did a religious movie without any religion in it?! There are some western examples of movies that try the same thing, but in a different way, like the recent Ridley Scott directed Exodus, where it tries to show the Exodus story but with a scientific approach of how it could have happened without any supernatural occurrences. This is not it, it just veers away from religion every time something religious is about to happen. Very strange decision as it affects the flow of the movie and especially the ending is almost incomprehensible if you don't have the religious background. This leaves us with a Ben-Huresque kind of story, with a nice direction, nice rhythm, so so animation and a very confused audience. Not terrible. Not amazing."
" Waist of time
",2020-08-30 00:00:00,1,"Just a waist of time.don't waist your time watching this.
The only positive thing was animal designs"
" Inspiring
",2020-08-12 00:00:00,9,"Loved it ! Truly felt how blessed we are , how lucky we are to be born in a muslim family., living in a muslim state, Allah has made our lives so easy, we are not facing any hardships for following islam.."
" Best animation ever made in the history of animation
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,10,My mind just blew away while watching this animation made by a Pakistani. If i would have million thumbs I shall made all thumbs up. My home cinema showed its best output ever. God bless the team who made it.
" My most favorite movie
",2020-06-30 00:00:00,10,"What a beautiful way to teach history.....The slow mo, the action, the music effects and the conversation in the movie is sooooo good that I can't just write about it now.In a nutshell, it's the best movie with everything where it should be and how it should be..."
" Soul touching Movie!
",2020-06-26 00:00:00,10,This Movie is a masterpiece for me. It inspired me for my life and represent values that every human should have. Never give up on your Vision!
" Mid 30's & dropped tears on slavery scenes
",2020-06-13 00:00:00,10,I live in Makkah & I remembered floyd & hated what did happened to him even more. WE ARE THE SAME PEOPLE KILL RACISM PLEASE AWAKE FROM DARKNESS.
" propaganda sold as heroship
",2020-06-09 00:00:00,2,"I watched the whole movie even though it looked waste after like 20 minutes.For me, movies are about story. Don't bother, this has no story at all. They didn't even try, that was never the goal.This was the very first movie I met with clearly biased ratings and reviews. If you check the reviews (and trivia), they are being proud of the beauty and glorious difficulty of animating. Is this really that important?Last, this Islamic thing for me is just propaganda. Do you need an excuse to cover all the war in the name of religion because of freedom? Knowing the slaving methods of Islam, this just looks lame."
" Best Movie for Kids
",2020-05-27 00:00:00,10,"Just had a mind blowing experience as an adult, The movie explains the core essence of Humanitarian rights and equality. Must say watch with kids and family for a mind blowing family time."
" Tears in my eyes
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,10,"Beautiful portrayal of bilal ibn rabah! I wish I saw this movie sooner. I was so into this movie I felt so sad because its ending, beautiful adaption just loved it."
" Defending equality
",2020-05-24 00:00:00,1,Some were surely paid to give a score of ten... So I give one to respect the message of the film...
" Intolerance in any name!
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,2,"Intolerance, no matter however beautifully animated is intolerable. Whether in the name of one or many gods. So those guys of many gods disparaged you and your one god. So you fought many wars to only then disparage their gods?!! This passes for a moral story??? So disappointed!"
" I really liked this film
",2020-05-19 00:00:00,10,Thank You Barajoun and the team for bringing Bilal's story to the screens. The animation is top class and the characterization is perfect. A must watch movie for all ages.
" The best movie i have seen since long long time!!!!!!!
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,10,"Amazing quality, amazing soundtrack, amazing story! I will watch it 100 times!"
" I loved it
",2020-05-12 00:00:00,10,"Emotional movie we want movies like this for our heroes in Islam, we have so many amazing real characters
Everything in this movie beautiful"
" Kudos for trying, but...
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,4,"All the dialogue is too literal and undercut by its stolid earnestness, and all of the characters are left underdeveloped.
The animation feels like the result of the cold calculus of an algorithm rather than a human director with a personal vision. Human body movements are stiff, awkward, and mechanical."
" Great movie
",2020-03-25 00:00:00,10,We really enjoyed this movie. The drama and suspense were excellent. Beautiful animation.. This doesn't seem like a film for children.
" Nicely done
",2020-03-16 00:00:00,5,"It did strike me from beginning as very well done story.
Unfortunately in the end it is just another Religious proaganda.
I wish I could have watch this with my kids without the need to tell them about the harm done by single or plural religious entities of the world."
" Where did this gem come from?
",2020-03-15 00:00:00,10,My God such a powerful message and insight into history. I highly recommend for the young ones and adults alike to watch this master piece.
" An Atheists review
",2020-03-08 00:00:00,3,"When making a film about a religious figure there are different ways to approach the subject either to find the best story, the most religiously accurate or the most historically accurate. This does none of that.I had done no research before watching the film and was unsure even half way through if this was poor propaganda for Christianity or Islam, but it was clearly apologist for some faith.After watching it I did some research to understand the background:
The early life of Bilal ibn Rabah is rather uncontroversial historically, but Sunni and Shia views about his later deeds are very different so the movie chooses to skip those controversies. It could still have made for a good movie but instead we get a one-dimensional character that does very little yet is somehow supposed to be a hero of peace while he dreams of war. It does not make sense.I hope to see better from this studio in the future. They do decent animation, have enough money for good voice actors, so the potential is there, but if they remain so afraid of offending Muslims they should stop with religious motifs."
" Worse 3D Movie so far...
",2020-02-21 00:00:00,1,"False rating of 8.0 must be reported or maybe people have such bad taste.
A Waste of time."
" not true story
",2020-02-11 00:00:00,1,"95% of the story is made up, to the director of the movie who is supposed to be a muslim, you DO NOT have to make a story out of nothing when it comes to a religious character because that just going to distort the history of this character with wrong stuff
."
" It was underwhelmng
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,4,"I did not like the idea of fictionalizing any of the companions of the Prophet (PBUH) for the sheer fact that they are a source of guidance for Muslims, and hence everything they did or said after accepting Islam becomes a model for Muslims to follow. Despite clearly stating at the outset that the film is a fictionalized version, I still find it a bit risky to show young, impressionable minds this film. Although, I must acknowledge the importance of bringing to light through a broader platform, like an animated feature film, the stories of the companions, but since this film manipulated the story of Bilal (RA), I would not recommend it. However, the issue of corruption, tyranny and inequality have been dealt with, which merited it getting a 4-star rating from me."
" Goal of the story
",2020-01-21 00:00:00,2,"Goal of the story might be in a good way, but some of the scenes are totally against Islam. It is sad to see these in such a nice(!) work."
" Covers an unexplored part of history
",2020-01-13 00:00:00,8,"This may not be a Pixar-level animated film, but give this movie a chance. It covers a part of history rarely explored in film. It tells the story of an important figure in Islamic history, a black man who had been forced into slavery.We rarely see slavery and racism explored in contexts outside the pre-civil war American Deep South, but it was something that has plagued humanity from centuries before.The main characters are Bilal and his sister Ghufaira, two characters of color. Not only do they add racial representation to the slate of animated fare, they also provide a great example of loyalty and devotion to family. Bilal truly IS a new breed of hero, because at his core, he was a humble man, very different from your typical outspoken hero. We see him dream, we see him fail, we see him persevere, we see him lose hope, we see him struggle and keep fighting, and we see him grow into a leader. When he does speak out, it is to speak out against the injustice of slavery.However, the movie has quite a big narrative problem with its focus. Bilal's story is about obtaining freedom from slavery and fighting to end slavery. But this struggle is conflated with the political strife between the prophet Muhammad PBUH and the leadership of Mecca. The attack on Mecca is treated as the climax to Bilal's story, but this gets confusing because the political conflict is not directly addressed. The prophet is never mentioned by name. Islam is never mentioned by name. If you weren't familiar with Islamic history, you wouldn't even be able to place any of the events in historic context.It makes sense that Bilal returns to Mecca to free the slaves and that's a fitting end to his story. But his return to Mecca has everything to do with his allegiance to the prophet and to Islam. Yet, neither are mentioned and we never even see Bilal accept Islam. The movie ends with Bilal climbing onto the Kabah for the call to prayer, but it cuts to black before he starts the adhaan.I understand that the filmmakers did not want to make overt religious references, but leaving them out completely only served to make the movie narratively confusing. Bilal is famous as the first ever muezzin (the one who performs the adhaan), so why not end the movie with him performing the call? It would have been much more powerful that the brief adhaan that is performed just before Akon's song plays over the credits. It seriously undercuts what should have been a powerful moment.But these issues notwithstanding, I'm glad that a movie about this even exists. Please support initiatives like this, so we can get more movies like this of better quality in the future."
" New breed of failures of arabic cinema
",2020-01-03 00:00:00,3,"I'm Muslim myself and the makers of this movie did a bad job, I'm reviewing it now in 2020 because I didn't want to watch it for five years because I didn't want to be disappointed.The makers of this (what is supposed to be a biography) were trying so hard to satisfy western audience by hiding the Islamic identity, and actually showing the ""sword"" instead of showing the peaceful message of Islam, this mess caused a real damage to the story line and no wonder if non Muslims are disappointed.I give 4 stars for the soundtrack and some good scenes."

" A sugar coated version of propaganda.
",2019-12-11 00:00:00,1,"I get people are proud and will justify their religion anyway neccessary. But let's fact check. 1. Muslim countries still have forms of slavery today. From Shira law to subjugation. If you dare to argue this fact, then you have never been or actually spent real time and opened your eyes there. 2. I could go on but why I am to tired of this same old crap."

" not satisfying
",2019-07-03 00:00:00,1,The movie isn't satisfying for me i think that there to much information about the story which weren't showed or clarified the...... the animating is good for people who aren't expert in this thing but not that much compared with the famous animations we know last important thing is that the sequence of the story was a bit disorganized
" awesome, super
",2019-06-22 00:00:00,10,It is brilliant and its a type of movies which you get an idea get something when finishing the movie especially it's the real story
" Brutal but with a message
",2019-04-11 00:00:00,10,"I didn't expect this to be this good. The animation is so crisp sometimes the characters look uncannily like flesh and blood people. The story is a lot darker than I expected for an animated film. Its a tale about enslavement and rebellion, don't think there's any room to kid around with that.The voice talent was superb and the action sequences were all around brutal. Seriously, there's no kidding around with this story. But the message behind it all is to show your fellow man and woman compassion. Hate and vengeance can be conquered by love and understanding, but always be prepared to fight against this who do not possess a strong enough will to see their own faults or frightened to have their beliefs challenged.Bilal shows this. You fight for what you believe in, but you should also understand why there is a fight to begin with."

",2019-01-12 00:00:00,1,"I never wrote IMDB reviews. But the only reason I write this one is that I was fooled by this movie rating. My bad for not checking the comments and discover all the fake reviews bought with Dubai dirty money.This movie is an utter piece of garbage. Boring as looking at a wall for 10 hours (yes, for me it felt that long). Tron has better 3D scenes that this movie. This surely was made by a bunch of amateur students of a 3d animation school. And not to mention is trying to make Islam look like a beautiful religion of love and peace (if you forget the part where it says 'kill all the infidels'). No: Islam is medieval and backward, tell your lies to clueless SJW, people with brains know Islam for what it is."

I just don't understand the IQ level of the other people who are giving this crap of a story / animated film a higher than a ""2"" Rating on any review depot. OPEC Money must be subsidising all of them to do so?
My advice to all: Don't waste your precious time. Watch a ""War"" movie instead and feel better about yourself!"

" This movie is actually 3 starts, but had to give one to bring up some balance to the made up reviews.

" Very, very funny...
",2018-09-22 00:00:00,5,"I did know what to expect. I thought it will be something like Kudo but I could never guess that I will have so much fun.The story is about one of the most trusted general of Muhammad: Bilal ibn Riyah. So do not get me wrong but when I hear one of the most repeated sentence in this story is ""freedom and equality"" - that's 
really makes me laugh... Muhammad was many things but tolerant he was not and freedom also have very different meaning to him and his followers. So if you know anything about this culture and system of thought than you will have fun. If not - you will be rather bored and may even think ""what a nobel guys they were""...Other than that the animation is really impressive sometimes and rendering looks great. Good voice acting."

It pissed me off so much to the point were i thought the one who made the movie is a nonmuslim who is trying to hide the real story. Why as muslims would you ever do this??????"
" Movie against racism and human slavery.
",2018-09-11 00:00:00,9,This movie should've grossed like millions. It shows how a real story should be not of super heroes flying in the sky(have you seen em in real life?). This story shows how Bilal and his sister face racism and human slavery.
" Disjointed and dry
",2018-08-31 00:00:00,2,"I always like to say something good about a movie -every movie has at least something positive, after all. The animation was acceptable. This is not a ringing endorsement since computers, software and those skilled at working with them should be able to bring something visually decent to the screen.
As a story, it was difficult to follow at times, but if you can stomach the boredom, it is not a bad story. Worth it? Hardly (and I didn't have to pay to see it). It is not the worst film ever brought to screen (never understood those comments) but the goal was supposed to include giving a better, newer perspective on the islamic culture. It fails miserably at this, and in truth it just was not a very good story. Maybe it loses something in the translation (culturally speaking) but while I love animated movies, this one will find no place in my library."

" One of the greatest Movies of all time
",2018-08-01 00:00:00,10,"I agree with all the people rating the movie below 5, it's not their fault because the movie could have shown so many other things. The movie lacks many information and many scenes as I know the original story.
If you were not satisfied by this movie it's totally understandable but I highly suggest you to please The Message (1976), that shows the same story but from a different angel and is considered to be the best Islamic movie in the history of mankind."
" Irony in its purest form.
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,3,"""Being a warrior won't make you a great man. If you are chained to anger and vengeance. superstition and fear are chains too. To be a great man you have to break free of them all.""Powerful words to start a story. Which makes it infinite times ironic to end this movie with a strong religious message. His faith in this 'one god' that weirdly appears out of thin air in the middle of this movie is also superstition! Fail.3/10 because the animation, sounds and music was decent."
" I am free.
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,8,"The story takes place in Mecca during the early days of Islam. Bilal was a slave and an early convert. His origins disagree with Wikipedia, but what else is new. They shows some violence, minor blood, and torture. The graphics were less than what we have grown used to and the fighting motions were poorly done.Bilal was a friend of Mohammad, who we never see because of the Islamic ban on showing any likeness of him which made the film a bit awkward. So this is a tale about the early days of Islam that never mentions Allah or Mohammad. The film preaches equality of the races and class."
" Islamic propoganda
",2018-07-28 00:00:00,1,"This movie is blatant Islamic propaganda. I can not tolerate religious brainwashing of kids. i would rate this movie 0 if i could.The story is not good, generic at best. The character development is non existent as the main character is spoon fed by others throughout the movie.The animation is does not accurately represent the races, especially the african race. Overall a waste of time."
" 10 out of 10 Muslims Recommend XD
",2018-07-27 00:00:00,1,"This is not a good movie. All the Muslims love it and give it high ratings, because they are proud of the first animated Muslim film. Wooo so exciting! Crap movie."
" Five at best, and only for the animation
",2018-07-26 00:00:00,5,"On a technical aspect, the animation is first rate. Unfortunately, the story is muddled. It's about a slave in the Arab world challenging the rightness of slavery - proclaiming he is free. That's okay to that point, but the film is muddled from then on. Who is the mysterious stranger convincing Bilal of the idea of freedom? Who is the mysterious warrior who trains him? Who are the others who go to war against the slavers? We are never told. I guess the problem is the filmmakers are up against the same restrictions as every journalist in the western world - you can't depict Mohammed in any form.Worse, slavery thrived in the Arab world after these events. Arabs were the primary providers of the Americans' slaves. Where slavery continues today (!) it's primarily in the Arab world. And Islam only served to cement this autocratic system.So the story wants us to believe that Bilal was ""one of the first to challenge the institution of slavery."" I guess the film makers conveniently forgot about Spartacus (against the Romans in the first century B.C.) and the Jews) about 4,000 (!) years ago against the Egyptians).So the film gets a 5 for its technical aspects, but a 1 for story. Pure propaganda that convinces only the already convinced."
" A movie that puts Arab animation on the map!
",2018-07-25 00:00:00,8,"I've heard that this is the first and only animated movie from the middle east. They have certainly made a calling card! 
It can be best described as a mix between Prince of Egypt and Kingdom of Heaven. A slave stands up to overthrow his masters. A classic tale, with a twist of historical truth. The animation is nothing short of stunning. Every detail of clothing and hair is rendered to perfection and the filmmakers like to remind you of that every other scene by putting their handiwork in close-up. The message is strong and the battle scenes epic. However what this movie lacks is a sense of consisincy. Sometimes you take a leap forward in time and the story picks up somewhere almost random. Nothing prepares you for it, and it feels like you are missing chunks of the story. Like how the hell did the main characters only arrived in a city in one shot and have created an army to rally against slave masters in the next? I do have to point out that despite it looking like an exciting, adventurous movie for the family, it really isn't. For an animated movie it has it's cut of pretty violent battle scenes and harsh deaths. Like i said; reminds a lot of Kingdom of Heaven.So though a bit rough at the edges, it is certainly worth to watch, and our western animation studios can certainly learn something from this one!"
" Just Awesome...
",2018-07-25 00:00:00,10,"First time I saw a Islamic animated film.
It was Awesome, when I seeing Bilal, I just feel respect for them who sacrificed they're everything for Almighty Allah.....!!!

" Bilal: A New Breed of Hero Film Review By Logan Coleman
",2018-04-20 00:00:00,8,"Bilal: A New Breed of Hero are from the directors Khurram H. Alavi and Ayman Jamal. This country of this film was made for United Arab Emirates, it released overseas 2015 but just recently released in the United States in this month. This animated film is based on the life Bilal ibn Rabah, who was a companion in his later life to the prophet Muhammad. I honestly the enjoyed animation because it not the typical animation you see today and it reminds me more of the Prince of Egypt meets the animation of the humans from the Shrek films. I would suggest to parents this a PG-13 film for reasons of violence that is not horrendous. When it comes to the religious part of the film which is about Islam, the religion not directly mentioned but most people will realize what the story is about. I do believe the people of different religions will like this film because it points out the extremist people that are in the same religion as well as the non-extremists. The films editing was off as well. I am going against most other film critics; I am giving this film 8 stars out of 10."

" A new perspective about black slave muslims in early times of islam.
",2018-03-30 00:00:00,10,"I am basically an agnostic who happens to know the history of islam (along with other religion). This movie is historically very important for muslims and also rest of the world.Its a story of BILAL BIN RABAH an african slave who got his freedom and become one of early muslim. Historically he is one the most important islamic figure. Just imagine, the words of ""Call for prayer"" which was used by all the muslim ubiquitously 5 times a day from last 1400 years was actually first spoken by a black african slave.Coming to the movie, the story is amazing. what else u want, an ambitious black man was kidnapped along with his sister in his childhood and made slave in arabia. he got liberated and fight against vicious meccan slave master (usual slave stories in arabic version).Animation and dialogues were amazing. its well written and directed. Movie is mostly accurate with real events. no major ""freedom of creativity"" taken by writer.Conclusively, its an amazing and inspiring movie for everyone and specially for muslims.you will thank me after watching it. my rating 10/10."
" I love the idea But it's Not the Real story for Bilal
",2018-03-26 00:00:00,1,This movie is away far from the real story ! why u do such a thing ?!
" What a great visuals and what a great story
",2018-03-09 00:00:00,10,The visuals are unbelievable. If you watching this in 4K you will be shocked. Up to all that the story is amazing. Bilal's story is inspiring. Highly recommended. One bad thing is the lake of the side characters. You need to google their names to understand the history and the story behind the characters. Enjoy it.
" Does this really reflect Islam?
",2018-03-08 00:00:00,3,"I can understand that every nation are proud of their history, the brighter parts at least, what I do not understand is how Muslims are still fascinated about wars, concurring the world, and forcing everyone else to their faith, or else kill them. I thought that this was part of the past, then ISIS came, well many Muslims said that ISIS doesn't represent the true Islam, then Bilal movie came, I was super confused watching it, not sure what message it is trying to pass; yes there were lots of lengthy monologues that enforce some messages about freedom, peace etc. But the actual movie really contradicts with them, sorry to all Muslim friends out there, I understand that you push for this film for the love of your faith, you have all the right to promote your thoughts, but Bilal movie did it all wrong, why Omaya and the other bald dude are evil? because they run business and have thick eyebrows? what is the core thing that justified Muslims kill them? this I really don't get, this is the difference between me watching it as a non-Muslim, and Muslims watching it with their pre emotions (they already love the Islamic historical figures and hate their enemies), I was not convinced, I was actually scared, if it is that easy for Muslims to get excited about getting into wars and claiming angels on their side, then it makes a lot of sense of all the terrorism attacks we see everywhere, if that is the type of heroes Muslims want their kids to follow, then I guess that are still way too far from peace. So I repeat my question to me Muslims friends, does Bilal movie really reflect Islam? 
 
On the other side, I enjoyed the beginning of the movie, I liked Bilal the kid, but it seems that he is losing character as he grows, I liked the quality of graphics, was impressed with the animals (the horse, the eagle, the chicken), their movements, hair, feather textures were quiet impressive, liked the fabrics and the surroundings, but I didn't like the human animations, special facials, they looked too dull."
" Couldn't finish it!
",2018-02-28 00:00:00,2,"I have to admit that we Afroamericanos run after any movie with a black dude, so this is supposed to be an animation about a black hero that fought for his freedom, but it turned to be a confusing PR about Islam. I have nothing against Islam, I know lots of Muslim fellows, one of them is actually called Bilal (we call him BIG B), but this film doesn't really do good to Islam nor to Africans. Starts nicely, then few minutes later it becomes a lame boring enforced Islamic philosophical lectures, I am in the movies man, give me something to enjoy, don't trade African-slavery cause to sell your religion please, Muslims better avoid talking about slaves I guess as people know that it wasn't really about taking off chains from slaves necks. Anyways, I tried to watch it all to justify my $$, but I truly couldn't is it was becoming slower and lamer, I finally gave up and had to leave when the war started, it was super expected that the cool Muslim dudes in white will win the thick eye-browed villains in red. Sorry Bilal, it is 2 stars today, and only because I am in a good mood."
" Epic & unique!
",2018-02-27 00:00:00,10,"I don't care if it was released late or how much it take to make this piece of art! I saw a lot of animated movies (who didn't!), but it's the first one that really make me cry in many scenes.It's a super great start for modern Arabic animation industry & it's just a start!
I loved every scene & shot of it. Soundtrack, visual effects, script and of course the story. The story is unique and based on real events. Just remember that see it & then judge, and you won't regret!10/10"

" An inclusive, values-focused family film that confronts modern challenges while it entertains
",2018-02-15 00:00:00,8,"This film has garnered a great deal of negative press, from a one or two religiously anxious Muslims, as well as a greater number of non-Muslims whose stated objections to the film don't seem to explain the negativity of tone or severity of rating of their reviews.I honestly think that the potential of this film to facilitate meaningful discourse, both within and between different communities, is very frightening to some people. It is a film that is unilaterally critical of racism, which is not going to sit well with some people. I also think that, though an entertaining technical and artist triumph, this movie really makes a lot of subtle moves that people aren't going to catch if they walk in with a closed mind or a rigid idea of what the film ""should"" be. To situate this review, its important for you to know that I am a multiracial (including Black) identified Muslim born, raised, and living in the United States, partnered with a non-Black poc, secular non-Muslim. We intend to have children in the near future but do not have any currently. So I was interested in this movie both because of its connection to my faith and a historical/religious figure of great interest to me, and because I am always actively seeking films that I feel will support the kinds of values I wish to raise my future children with. I've worked extensively with children and families across many settings. Both myself and my partner found this movie to be more than satisfactory from both angles. I feel that it further does a very good job of depicting important core values and worldview of Muslims in a way that is understandable to people of other faiths, as well as secular people, while divorcing it from religious debate. It's not a movie seeking to convince you of anything, it just presents a snippet of history in a meaningful, yet entertaining way that also is spiritually significant for some viewers. It's very character-focused, and fleshes out some figures of that time period that aren't always the focus, which I found to be refreshing. The sound effects/sound track and sound editing are as good as the visuals, which are pretty top of the line. I feel like they dialed the ""realism"" of the faces back just a touch to keep it from being creepy, but there are definitely times when it feels like it could easily be a live-action film. There are a couple of odd inconsistencies (a map uses Latin transliteration but later a character is writing in Arabic script that appears ahistorical) but otherwise I appreciated the attention paid to detail. You really get a sense of a living world in every scene, and I loved that. Accusations that the more ""villainous"" characters are one dimensional are off-base and a bit disturbing. The handful of characters who are ""villains"" happen to be slave-owners - why does the Western media need us to humanize slavery? Addditionally, characters are not ""good"" or ""evil"" for the sake of being such - they all have histories and motivations that are touched on to different degrees. Despite that, one of the villains in the film actually engages in an act of mercy, and we are given the sense that this is the first step in him changing his ways (which is historically accurate, though there are parts of the movie that seem embellished for the sake of characterization). And this is just one example of the thoughtfulness and complexity of how this movie deals with moral issues. As a Muslim, I find myself wanting to watch this film again, because the more I reflect on it, the more I have little epiphanies about the subtle details that the filmmakers included, as relates to history, to the values and issues that the movie is focused on, and Islam. It is a very character driven movie, in a positive way that will appeal to kids, and the messages, though complex enough to hold the attention of adults, will likely translate clearly enough for kids as to provide a meaningful takeaway.There is some violence, but nothing worse than what is typically seen in the media. Themes of being merciful, and of avoiding violence whenever possible permeate the film, so while there are battle-scenes, I wouldn't say that it promotes gratuitous violence. But if you literally don't allow your children to watch any media, or don't watch any yourself, obviously this will be an adjustment. The movie also treats trauma and loss with sensitivity throughout. Overall, the only reason I didn't give this movie a 10/10 is that 1) I almost never give movies perfect scores and 2) the pacing was a little lackluster, which stands out in an otherwise excellent movie."

" Amazing animation, fascinating historical storyline
",2018-02-07 00:00:00,9,"This film sets the bar for jaw dropping animation! The fight scenes and the flying eagle are astounding visual effects. The whole movie is surreal, because the animation looks so lifelike, yet is hand drawn.The storyline is based on the real life historical figure of Bilal Ibn Rabah, a close companion of the prophet Mohammed. It reminds me a lot of the story of Jesus and Moses. Even if you are not religious, this film will still be enjoyable since it is always entertaining to learn about other cultures and beliefs.There are many lessons in this film. The main take away is learning about the ties that keep you from becoming your true self. We are inundated with messages 24/7 from other people, TV, radio, the media, the Internet and, sometimes we lose track of who we want to be because of all those messages in our heads. This movie is very relevant today, because it reminds us to listen to our heart, slow down and think about what is really important. There is some violence, which is inappropriate for younger children. The movie is about slavery and breaking free, not only from your physical chains but your mental chains as well. The graphics are detailed and I recommend that an adult watch with their child. Slavery and history are violent subjects which should be discussed, but at an appropriate age. It is full of historical lessons including the purpose of idols, gold, slaves and greed. It shows how it is better to love and cherish people, rather than a phone, computer, car or idols. The story also deals with the bonding among siblings and the lengths they go to protect each other. I can relate to this as I would do anything to protect my sister. I admired the bond between Bilal and Ghufaira. Bilal is a very caring person. He shows his love for his sister by defending her and giving her all he has. He is also true to his word. These qualities make Bilal a one-of-a-kind hero and hence, my favorite character. The best scene in this film is when the two armies go to the battle field to fight. I love this scene because the animation is just mind blowing. I couldn't even tell if it was real or hand drawn. When I met the producers and writers of the film, I learned that the fight scene has 3251 plus fames in it. The animation is perfection. It is very detailed and clear. If this film ever enters an award ceremony it will win a prize, I'm sure. I recommend this film for ages 13 to 18 and give it 4.5 out of 5 stars. Younger kids would be challenged to understand it but teens will get it completely. The morals and the history make it perfect for families to watch together.Reviewed by Morgan B., KIDS FIRST!

",2018-02-05 00:00:00,10,The work that has been put into this movie is amazing. I liked the movie and how it shows the true reality of Islam and how it came to free people and make them equal.
" Promoting Religious Violence
",2018-01-31 00:00:00,1,"I was super excited about the movie, being a Muslim, thinking that finally someone is going to promote the true message of peace of Islam to the entire world! 
And I was extremely disappointed in every way! this movie was good in one thing: Propaganda (just have a look at obvious paid reviews and ratings everywhere), which got many people (like myself) excited till they watch the exact opposite on screen.The story shows how Savage Arabs attack the week and helpless Ethiopians (even though historically Ethiopia was a great Empire at that time controlling big chunk of Arabia and was about to concur Mecca!). So Bilal and his sister Gufera are enslaved by the bad Arabs. 
Then we see how Bilal remember the flashbacks of his mother that was killed by Arabs when she was incepting the values of peace and freedom in little Bilal, asking him to put the Sword aside.
So Bilal, helpless angry slave gets recruited by the Muslim brotherhood using the carrot of equality and freedom (in real life Bilal's moto was pure faith). He rebels, Ummayah puts a stone on his chest, Abubaker watches, and at the end he decides to buy Bilal. Gufera gets captured by Ummayah, but Bilal happily leaves her to join the Muslim brotherhood and starts practicing on how to wave swords and kill infidels. From this moment on, it is all about the climax holy war of Badr, you see other Muslim scholars being silly and doing nothing through the movie, till we see them brutally and excitingly killing infidels in that war with the help of glowing angels (yes they showed white glowing angels in full armor slaying infidels!) it the first time in movie history to show God literally taking sides and sending armored angels to kill the other non-believers, it is also the first time where an animated war scene takes that long, the film makers are so proud of the war they applied for Guinness to claim that record. They could easily claim the record for the most violent movie ever addressed for kids! I can't believe how it is rated PG-13, lots of killing and swords penetrating from one side going out from the other, arrows doing into chests and necks.. but after wiping the blood. So kids can watch it and take example from their Muslim role models!
And when PR people talk about it, it seems as if they talking about some other movie, they neglect the story and events of the film and repeat the PR articles that doesn't exist. Do they really want kids (Muslim and non Muslims) to get exposed to that holy war? what example and message would they get? I think only ISIS would be proud to show such a film to their kids! Making peace by killing all the others!What I am trying to say here is that Islam has nothing to do with all the terror in Bilal Movie, Bilal is a passionate believer, and his moto in life wasn't revenge (BTW he killed Ommayah in the worst way possible because he thinks that Ummayah killed Gufera, but he didn't!). Bilal wasn't a selfish seeker of freedom, Bilal wasn't a negative whiny kid who is good at nothing but killing, real Bilal was an example of commitment, dedication, and faith, he used his voice for Azan to unite all people. The film neglected all that, neglected the humanitarian values of Islam and Sahaba (Abu Baker, Ali, Hamza, Saad, Sohaib, & Bilal) and showed them as killers. It even picked Safwan Ibn Ommayah, the great Muslim Sahabi as the main villain, without even showing how he followed prophet Mohammad. This movie is an insult to Islam, humanity & Africans.With all that said, it is written and directed so badly that I was bored to death watching it, and finished it only because of the shock."
" Horses
",2018-01-30 00:00:00,9,"Amazing pictures of horses. I was mesmerized visually how pretty the characters were. I didn't even hear the background music. The action and slow motion of the scenes were amazing. The archery scene was amazing. Someone had to draw that or computer generated? It was not graphic with blood and gore, more like suggestive. Two plus hours of entertainment. It is suppose to be a real life story, but exaggerated. Is greed our God or is it equality? Slavery or freedom. Do people have a choice? He had a benefactor who bought his freedom and taught him wisdom and taught him how to fight the oppressor. Is this world not the same as 500 AD? We are fighting the same. Nothing has changed. We are still fighting power and greed and oppression and corruption."
