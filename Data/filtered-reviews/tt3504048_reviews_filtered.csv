" Quirky and entertaining
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,8,"A woman is forced into house arrest and must move back in with her mother, and if that wasn't bad enough, she starts to think that her mother's superstitions about the house being haunted may not be entirely in her head.An unexpected and quirky NZ horror-comedy (more comedy than horror) with just enough thriller to keep things interesting and preventing it from falling into repetitive tropes. Genuinely funny moments (mostly around family and bureaucracy) that enhance rather than undercut the story. Even the things I predicted didn't happen the way I expected. Having her monitor (for her ankle tracker) being an amateur paranormal investigator who completely buys into the premise more than the lead does was a great choice to lead this story down an unusual track. The cast chemistry is great and the mother-daughter relationship is not only believable, but a highlight.Worth a watch even for people who don't like horror films."
" Gets better everytime I watch it
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,8,"Liked this movie from the very first watch, it's a mish mash of other movies, not as good as The people under the stairs which is a classic but out of all the spooks in the house movies being knocked out by the dozen these days this one shines. The characters are Great lots of sarcastic dark humour that really works, I burst out laughing at kylies piss take face to Amos everytime her character is amazing, unflinching , strong and pretty kick arse, watching the bond grow between her and her mum is great and her mums character is shining by the end, the on the roof scene is really pretty cinematography and was the thing they stayed in my head after the first watch. Her Tag/promotion guy Amos is great and you feel a community spirit in the film, I've scene the baddy in other things cant remember what no big parts but he shined as the slime ball in this. It's such a great film from New zealand, just a action packed roller coaster of witty humour, angry daughters spooks gore and mystery, all played out brilliantly"
" Really have to admire New Zealand for a number of reasons
",2020-12-08 00:00:00,8,"One, this truly entertaining, fun movie that also has some genuine scares. Two, that when Kylie rips off an ATM in the beginning, instead of slapping her in jail they put her under house arrest and assign a counselor. Third, that every inch of this house is crammed with books! I love it."
" ""Housebound""
",2020-10-17 00:00:00,7,A highly entertaining movie with a solid plot. This is definitely one of the few films that balanced comedy and horror well.
" Welcome to the house of fun.
",2020-10-11 00:00:00,8,"Housebound is a dark, sombre toned black comedy with a few genuine chills thats goes from ghost story to murder mystery to psycho killer. Definitely a hidden gem and everyone involved deserved this to have been more well known. One of those films where it's best to go in blind and that way its much more fun.Solid performances with some sharp writing in places, some people might find it slightly uneventful for the first 30 minutes, however if you do, stay with it as it's well worth the wait.Especially the end pop."
" Not bad
",2020-10-06 00:00:00,6,"Well first off, Kylie's actress is great I really believed she's a damn b**** . Movie has a great asthetic. I wasn't too interested in the beginning but got better."
" It spiraled into incoherency...
",2020-10-02 00:00:00,4,"I sat down to watch the 2014 horror comedy ""Housebound"" without even having ever heard about it. I happened to stumble upon it by luck in 2020, and I was intrigued by the movie's cover. So of course I found myself sitting down to watch it.While the movie was watchable, and had some interesting aspects to it. I must say that ""Housebound"" from writer and director Gerard Johnstone was a swing and a miss. The movie was adequate for the first half, then it just felt like director Gerard Johnstone didn't know where to go and went at random locations in multiple locations all at once. The movie ended up going from being in interesting pseudo-haunting movie to a vagrant house squatter thing. What? It just made so little sense, and it totally destroyed everything that was build up in the first half of the movie.I will say that the acting in the movie was good, and it was refreshing to see a whole ensemble of unfamiliar talents on the screen. That is something that I enjoy in movies. Just a shame that the actors and actresses had a scrambled mess of a storyline to work with.For a horror comedy then ""Housebound"" was lacking severely in both departments and it wasn't really one or the other. So the movie failed to really entertain me. Yet I did manage to sit through the movie to the end.I am rating ""Housebound"" a less than mediocre four out of ten stars. The movie started out great, but then just fell into a pit of mud and never recovered."
" Housebound - 8/10
",2020-09-28 00:00:00,8,"Housebound has everything you could want from a horror-comedy. It balances both genres perfectly without giving way to one over the other. The acting's good, the character's are genuinely interesting and it maintains it's unpredictability right through to the final act.It follows Kylie, a young woman who, after unsuccessfully trying to rob an ATM, is placed under house arrest in her childhood home. Her mother, who she finds insufferable, insists that the house is haunted and not long after she moves back in, Kylie begins to suspect the same. Sounds like the set-up for a typical haunted house film, but give it a go and you're sure to be surprised.Morgana O'Reilly plays Kylie and really sells the anti-social attitude. Her facial expressions were great and she bounces off the rest of the cast really well. Rima Te Wiata plays Miriam, Kylie's Mum, who's very sweet and loveable. She can be frustrating at times, but it really lends to the comedy. Glen-Paul Waru was by far my favourite part of the movie, playing Kylie's security contractor who takes an interest in the paranormal activity. He's really funny and endearing, without ever feeling out of place in the more horror-infused scenes.I'd really recommend this one if you're looking for a good horror-comedy. Like a mash-up of The People Under the Stairs, Come to Daddy and Shaun of the Dead, so check it out if you liked any of those films."
" A bit creepy, a silly fun joke here and there, loved it!
",2020-09-06 00:00:00,9,"Just get some crisps, kick back and watch this film.
I was expecting a classic haunted house film but I got so much more!
A bit of horror, a touch of humor (just enough) and some intrigue.
Good acting, good story, good plot twists.
A must see"
" EXCELLENT! WHAT fun!
",2020-07-20 00:00:00,9,"Such a cute movie! First of all the lead actor is the spitting image of Rachel Weisz, if she'd been born in New Zealand with a different life. Same talent and cheeky humor.It's a ghost story in an old house, great fun, dont read the spoilers!.Why my cable company didn't pick this up I don't know. Actually I do know, they weren't very bright which is why I don't have them anymore. Ha!"
" Make mine with a twist...
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,6,Borrows heavily from many other movies in the genre but with an odd twist that will make you scratch your head. I would have scored it higher but the main character isn't likeable and therefore I didn't care what happened to her. Enough blood to keep it in the watch column though.
" A Mystery, A Family and The Housebound
",2020-06-19 00:00:00,9,"😱 First Impressions:
The box-art of the film really irks me. Maybe because at first glance it seems like a low-budget thriller that already hints at it being funny more so than scary. But at the same time, there is no deying that it is also creepy with the ghostly figure and grabbing Kylie's shoulder. Horror-comedies usually have issues with balancing the laughter and scares but lets see where it takes us...
Pros:
😋 The story is rather heartwarming concerning family and loss. Though most of it is overshadowed by the comedic back-and-forth between the family members and scare elements, but these do make sense because of their strained relationship. Then there's also the identity and finding of self. It's about a school dropout who's acting out and only through reconnecting with her family and unfortunately having been through a tragedy is the final push before a self-realization of how good one's got it in life.😋 It satirizes many branches of the horror genre. Probing of course the supernatural with the initial ""hauntings"" then it treads the creepy neighbor territory which is just that- a creepy neighbor. Then it makes it way to psychological horror where Kylie is being deemed as relapsing from not having taken her pills to suppress her DID and bipolar disorder (convincingly so too I almost rage). Before finally owning itself as a slasher film! It gets around all these before reasserting its own identity with a creepy person living within the walls. That to me is why this film is so successful.😋 Everyone plays their part convincingly. I didn't recognize anyone from this film before but I would very much love to see them again. Kylie gets the chance to display all the sides of her acting chops and it really shows~ I especially adored the woman who played Miriam but am also partial to Eugene's actor (who plays a small role but still memorable).Cons:
😪 Not much to say except as expected it is a horror comedy, so regardless of how best they tried to make it work, there will always be issues where there is just not the right time for a joke (don't get me wrong I still laughed) but it sometimes brought me out of the experience.😪 One last thing, during the blackout scene (which was really spectacular btw) it didn't make sense or rather I didn't quite get it. Dennis gets attacked most likely by Eugene (since we do see him and prized invisibility clock when the light was turned on for a split second). But that just goes outside of the latter's established personality. He is a shut in, very passive and he knows more but doesn't intervene. Unless Dennis himself tripped and injured himself, that could be it. That was just a little gap I couldn't quite wrap my head around.😇Verdict😈
In closing, a brilliant horror film that may seem a tad low-budget at times. But don't let that stop you because beneath it is a horror film with a very darn good story and strong performances. It also has quite a few terrific scares when the film lets you on about it being supernatural. Then it explores other angles of the horror genre before concluding as a remarkable slasher with a feel-good end."
" A True Sleeper. Not Scary.
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,9,"Teenager Kylie (Morgana O'Reilly) is arrested for a failure to blow up a ATM machine and is ordered to live with her mother, Miriam (Rima Te Wiata) for 9-months mostly because all other options of incarcerations have never worked on Kylie. Kylie has a terrible attitude and has an ankle bracelet to insure she stays within the house limits. Kylie's mother is on record as saying the house, her house, is haunted. Kylie and her mother do not get along.Kylie experiences many things that go bump in the night, but is a curious person on why these things happen, but she does not cower away from them but goes to where the noises happen to find out the truth behind these ""hauntings, but to no avail. Later she learns that a young girl was murdered in the house and the belief is that the young girl's spirit haunts the house and has not ascended to where most spirits go. Enter Amos (Glen-Paul Waru) a Security Officer and amateur paranormal investigator and he becomes an ally to Kylie as both try to figure out who killed the young girl years ago. At this point the movie becomes a murder mystery and not about a haunted house. The big clue Kylie finds are dentures that Kylie believes belonged to the killer.This is a true Sleeper, a movie that is very good, but no one knows about...yet. It is not scary, but could have been; somewhat comedic at times; and you will encounter many misdirections. Okay, I did jump when a hand grabbed Kylie's leg in the basement and actually, when you finish the movie you ask yourself why did that happen. Didn't make sense. But jump I did.Notables: Cameron Rhodes as Dennis, a court appointed Therapist; Mick Innes as Kraglund, who skins racoons, looks like a suspicious character and Kylie knows he wears dentures; Ryan Lampp as Eugene, a drifter that Kraglund lets stay in a secluded space and won't leave; Ross Harper as Graeme, Miriam's husband.The cinematography and stunts choreography, superb pacing and excellent acting all around are what makes this movie compelling to watch as we never know the direction the story will take. The problem throughout is that Kylie knows the truth, but can find no one to believe her. Well, except Amos.A New Zealand film that should have been given more and better promotion. It's really good. A true Sleeper. (9/10)Violence: Yes.
Sex: No.
Nudity: No.
Humor: Yes.
Scary Moments: Not really, but could have been.
Language: No.

" Tonal conflict
",2020-06-04 00:00:00,7,"It's hard to tell if this is a horror movie trying to be a comedy, or a comedy movie trying to be a horror. There are times when the tone really conflicts and I'm not sure what to make of it. The style of humour is perhaps too New Zealand specific for most audiences and even I couldn't relate to most of it. None of this makes it a bad film - it's definitely not - but it is a confusing one."
" Cute but overhyped
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,7,"It's a nice horror with good comedic parts and a nice final twist, but it's not THAT good.
The most interesting concept gets used only in the last 20 minutes or so and it feel wasted.
The start is slow but the acting is good.
Overall an entertaining and fresh horror but not the masterpiece most reviewers seem to have seen."
" Excellent Surprise Worth Watching!
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,9,Excellent dark comedy! It flies under the radar due it being a NEW ZEALAND Indie flick. It's a good chance that you know someone that's like at least 1 of the characters.
" Refreshing
",2020-02-14 00:00:00,7,A refreshing take on horror. With the right amount of bad eggs to keep it interesting. Worth a watch.
" Well done New Zealand!
",2020-01-22 00:00:00,8,"This movie, has given me a new appreciation of the New Zealand movie industry.
What a surprise!... and a worthy one at that.
This was hilarious! The director/writers/actors/editors were brilliant. Some of the scenes left you laughing out loud and were so cleverly thought out.
It not your usually 'horror' theme, with the usual gore, so if you expect that, then move on.
The main character and her mother really make the movie, and as I wrote earlier, this movie opened my eyes up to the New Zealand movie trade.
I'm not going to spoil you with what it about, so the best way to watch this movie is to not know much at all, and you will be pleasantly surprised.
This movie, has been one I recommend for others to see, as its entertaining, funny, and you won't just get a smirk on your face but a good laugh out loud experience. Well done New Zealand."
" Pretty good movie
",2019-12-28 00:00:00,7,I normally don't like movies with heavy accents because it's so distracting to me. Subtitled movies are better IMO but this one wasn't too bad. I was genuinely surprised by the plot twist and that's hard to do with me. I took me until the end to warm up to the main character though. Maybe she played flaming B too well. Or maybe that was just damn good character arc writing lol but the comedic relief was really refreshing and well placed with pacing.
" New Zealand Horror Comedy
",2019-12-24 00:00:00,4,"While I was watching this movie, I had a feeling I may have seen it before, but couldn't say for sure. I think that sums up the effect it had on me--familiar and forgettable. I wasn't much interested in the main character, and the movie depends on her performance. Also, I didn't realize it was a horror-comedy until the third act. Up until that point, it didn't seem like it was going for laughs."
" Oh Wow
",2019-10-27 00:00:00,9,"What a GREAT film.
It's Kiwi to the bone, no Hollywood glitz here just an entertaining film.
To make a film like this on shoe string budget is a truly fantastic achievement. Anyone who was involved in putting this together, go ahead and give yourselves a big pat on the back."
" Great suspense and laughter
",2019-10-23 00:00:00,8,This movie was great. Kept me laughing and guessing. Perfect mix of laughs and suspense. Great job at making light of a dark situation.
" Fun Little Flick
",2019-10-17 00:00:00,6,"Apparently, New Zealand is a breeding ground for horror comedies (""Dead Alive"", ""What We Do in the Shadows"", this film), and I think I'm okay with that. While this movie doesn't live up to the other two films mentioned, it does have a certain level of charm, and it has a few twists and turns along the way that give the story a little more oomph than your average horror/comedy. I wouldn't say I thought this film was amazing, but I certainly got a few chuckles out of it, and I jumped a few times, and it left a good enough impression that I'd watch something else from the director if given the chance."
" Incredible!
",2019-10-02 00:00:00,10,"Laughed and screamed alternately the whole way through!
I had no idea that such a Comedy/Horror/Mystery combo was even possible.
Well done!"
" terrific film, packed full of genres!
",2019-09-16 00:00:00,8,"In this New Zealand comedy/horror/thriller/mystery, a minor criminal is sentenced to a few months of house arrest to be served at her mom's. Surly and unrepentant, she sits around and mopes or yells at her mom until she's distracted by mysterious sounds in the walls that her mother is convinced are part of a haunting.This starts off as comedy and then seamlessly zigs and zags through other genres. It is a movie that can ramp up the tension and then toss in a little slapstick, and it works beautifully. The movie spends half its' time leading the audience in a particular direction and the other half confounding audience expectations, yet at the end it all makes (reasonably) perfect sense.The lead isn't especially personable, but that is appropriate for the character so I can't complain that much. Her mother is lovely and often very funny."
" Extremely underrated
",2019-08-09 00:00:00,9,"Just a fantastic film, it really works on every level. It's also hard to define, because it moves so smoothly between the genres. Relatively speaking, some parts have a Tim Burton-feel to them, while others are more mystery/horror moments a la The Conjuring, but it never takes itself to seriously, which is why it all works so well. The humor is more subtle, but it's kind of like Shaun of the Dead.Both Rima Te Wiata and Morgana O'Reilly deliever strong performances. And it's fun to see how their intricate relationship develops throughout the film. O'Reilly in particular brings a lot to her role, especially in the way she interacts with the other actors, which is where most of the comedy happens.Her character is also very interesting, sort of like 'Coraline' in the beginning, when she was bored out of her mind but always curious. She(O'Reilly) is also quite captivating, which doesn't hurt. Never a dull moment.9/10"
" Interesting Concept with Solid Reveal
",2019-04-26 00:00:00,7,"This was a film I checked out as part of a movie club for a podcast I listen to. I didn't know a lot about this film, but had heard some people who seen it when it came out and spoke pretty highly about it. The synopsis is a young woman is forced to return to her childhood home after being placed under house arrest, where she suspects that something evil may be lurking.The film starts with a couple as they try to rob an ATM. The film sets the tone with the comedy as the robbery is bungled. They're arrested and we see the woman is Kylie Bucknell (Morgana O'Reilly). Her lawyer is trying to get her out of doing jail time by going to rehab, but the judge sees been given this opportunity before. He instead forces her to house arrest with her mother and step-father in her childhood home.She is brought to the house and we get introduced to the mother, Miriam (Rima Te Wiata) as she crashes into the car that Kylie is in. From there we see the two of them bump heads and don't really get along. It doesn't help that Kylie is rude and doesn't listen to anyone.We are then introduced that Miriam believes the house is haunted. She calls into a radio program telling about an experience she had where she saw a figure that looked like a sheet in her basement. Kylie doesn't believe it, but Miriam points out things that she said as a child that coincides with her experiences.Kylie pushes the boundaries of her tether and this draws the attention of Amos (Glen-Paul Waru). He lives nearby and he is the one that monitors her. Her psychologist that is assigned to her is Dennis (Cameron Rhodes) who is trying to help and get her on a positive track with this experience.Things take a turn when Kylie hears something in the night that draws her to the basement. A hand grabs his ankle and she freaks out. Amos thinks it could be ghosts and as a paranormal investigator on the side, he tries to prove it. This leads to discovering what this house was before they purchased it and to a murder that occurred there. A dental plate is found and Kylie along with Amos tries to solve who it belongs to. It leads them on a crazy discovery of what is really going on in the house.Now I have to say, this film is quirky. I really like the structure of Kylie as a character. There are so many layers to her as well as to the film and I think it is really genius. First, she is a criminal and is stuck in the house. That helps to contain it and build tension since she can't legally leave. Being that she is a criminal, that makes her unreliable and no one believes her. It doesn't help that she is rude either, so that makes people not want to help her as well. There is a subtle reveal later in the film that she diagnosed as being bipolar. She claims it was a lie so she could get drugs, but it is on her file which makes you think that something she sees might not be real as well.I will admit though I had trouble getting into this film at first. They establish that they could it could be a ghost. At first, that seemed like a cool concept in that she couldn't leave. The film kind of meandered for a bit there and the tension just wasn't building for me. After a reveal that happens at about the mid-way point changed that for me and I started to think of things that happened previously. I was hooked then and the film does build tension to a solid conclusion.Something that I wasn't the biggest fan of in this one was the comedy. It really didn't work for me overall, but there were a few things here and there that made me chuckle. Now this doesn't hurt the film though. This film is played pretty straight for the most part; where the comedy is there to just kind of give a bit of levity.To the acting of the film, I really liked O'Reilly. She did piss me off for the first half of the film. I think that was part of the reason I had trouble getting into the film, as she is such a horrible person that I couldn't stand what she was doing. I did find her attractive and I could see there was a good person so I have to commend her for that. Wiata was pretty funny with how odd she was. She really adds something to film. Waru was solid as well. Ross Harper I thought was an interesting character and really changes the dynamic of the film once he is introduced. Rhodes has an interesting character change as well. The rest of the cast rounds out the film for what is needed as well.Effects of the film were pretty solid as well. They were done practically, which I really liked. There is a scene where someone is stabbed in the leg and it made me cringe for what they do. The blood in the film has a good color and consistency. There are some times that they go overboard with it for a laugh, which I didn't mind. I would say that the film is shot very well also.Something that really didn't stand out to me was the soundtrack of the film. The use of sound though I wanted to touch on. We hear noises in the wall, which I thought was a good touch. It is an unsettling feeling when they think it is a ghost, but it makes quite the turn when we learn what is really causing it. The use of tape recorders is also something that was solid.Now with that said, this was a film I wasn't really feeling at first until the reveal of the film. That is when I really got sucked in and wanted to see how this film played out. The acting of the film really helped. I hated Kylie, but she really turned it around. The comedy didn't really land for the most part, but it did make me chuckle at times. The pacing of the film was a bit off for me until that reveal, but it did end up building tension to a solid conclusion. The effects were good. The score of the film didn't stand out, but the use of sound was solid. I would say this is a solid film from New Zealand and I would say that overall it is above average."
" Fun and scary!
",2019-03-12 00:00:00,9,"This is a Movie that keeps on giving - it has many sides to the plot. It´s a ghost Movie, no, wait, it´s a murder story, no wait...it constantly Changes and the tongue in cheek humour is great! One of my favorite Movies, for sure."
" A Fun Comedy Horror
",2019-02-12 00:00:00,8,"Title: HouseboundFormat: DVD Language: English Released: 2014Director: Gerard JohnstoneStarring: Morgana O'Reilly, Rima Te Wiata, Glen-Paul WaruRecently a steady stream of horror films have made their way to this small Island from down under. Housebound, is the latest, hailing from New Zealand. Gerard Johnson's debut film is a mix of both comedy & horror in the style I expect from that part of the world.It's not in any way straightforward, by that I mean, what you get is not what you expect with this film; this is a good thing. The comedic content is there throughout but acts only to enforce the horror aspect of the film in a way that has become something of a signature for work from this area of the world.Our heroine is Kylie Bucknell (Morgana O'Reilly), a troubled youngster with a criminal list that would make a London 'mobster' proud. Sentenced and placed under house arrest, she is tagged and sent back to her Mother's house to serve out said sentence.It's not long after this that 'things' start to happen that give her cause for concern. The scene is nicely set with a radio phone-in, near the start. Kylie's Mother, Miriam Bucknell (Rima Te Wiata) has called to share her experience of a paranormal incident from her past. Giving us, the viewers, all the background we need to start to create a backstory in our minds.The film then follows what seems like a normal haunted house story until it's twisted on its head and we are shown other possibilities (can't really say more without ruining it for you). This is played on throughout by Gerard, when you think you have worked out what is going on, he throws in another smokescreen, using all the rules of horror to twist it around and then as you start to get on top, he throws in another misdirection with the use of some top comedy to knock you off the scent.It's not a complex story nor does it try to be, it just a fun roller-coaster of a ride through one outrageous situation to another. All in all, this adds up to a satisfying conclusion and leaves a good feeling once it is all over.Housebound is a simple but clear story. Well-made and with some great acting in it. Watch it on your own and it can be creepy as hell; watching it with friends gives it a whole different, fun feeling. Housebound is a film I personal can watch over and over again but still enjoy it as much as the first time I saw it."
" Predictably & Unpredictably
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,6,"Negatives:
No menu thus no chapter, or specials and most importantly no subtitles. N.Z. English dialect made even more not-understandable by other English speakers w/shaky enunciations, and poor audio level control.
Predictable Negatives:
Creepy house; creepy hand pokes it's way from under cabinet; creepy basement, behind walls passages, and attic; shadowy figures; white sheeted something; lights go off; doors close/open; talking doll/toy; past murders in house; creepy neighbor. So 90% is unimaginative, done a thousand times before setup for horror. But, ...
Positives:
They provided a couple of twists at the end to make the film tolerably different. It's just wading through it all to get there."
" Very enjoyable horror comedy.
",2018-11-13 00:00:00,6,"Well now, this was a nice surprise from New Zealand. We've seen movies before where the protagonist is placed under house arrest (100 Feet, Disturbia, etc), but this was a haunted house story with a difference. We have a rebellious young women, pushover parents, a suspicious neighbor, a man living within the walls of the house, a few twists, genuine scares and laugh out loud moments.The film has very good cinematography and excellent sound effects. The acting is also very good, especially Rima Te Wiata as the mother. The daughter is by far the strongest character, played by Morgana O'Reilly, and it was nice to see her transition from rebel to hero. The film has a fantastic blend of humor and horror, with some nail biting suspense moment in the mix as well. The film turned more comedic towards the end, but it was thoroughly enjoyable and very effective."
" A bit of humor, a skosh of violence, some scary, lots of surprises and you've got yourself one damn entertaining movie!
",2018-09-17 00:00:00,10,"This movie seems to have it all. Starts off with a robbery of an ATM. (Believe it or not there's a bit of humor right from the start.) Then turns into a genuinely creepy and scary ghost story, then it turns into..... well, never mind, I don't want to give anything away! I'll just say there's more humor, a bit of violence, and lots of surprises. Funniest scene was when one character takes the kitchen knife from another character. Trust me. I was laughing my britches off! Great ending too!"
" Had Me Guessing About A Few Things Up Til The End
",2018-08-23 00:00:00,8,"This was a movie that I found myself both loving and hating. Kylie is a frustrated delinquent who has been sent home with her mother for house arrest in hopes of finding a way to rehabilitate her delinquent ways. Her mother, while obviously loving, is somewhat chatty, naive and a little superstitious, which only comes to light after she calls in to a radio talk show to discuss how she believes her home is haunted. One thing leads to another and before long we learn a strange backstory for the house that includes the murder of a young girl, a strange neighbor and Kylie having to question what she believes about everything.The plot of the story isn't very unique but it has a few laughs and, honesty, the young lady who plays Kylie did such a good job acting out her despicable attitude, she really had me wanting to yank her around a bit. She did a great job with that! The horror aspect moved from spooky, to creepy and then to some blood but the blood parts, while having a really good moment, could've been so much more. Took off some points only because they could've taken this so much farther but overall I liked it."
" Was pleasantly surprised!
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,9,"Others have covered most things well already so I will keep it short without giving anything away... I really was not expecting much from this movie as most movies put out these days leave finding an entertaining watch few and far between. That said, I am so glad I gave this one a shot! The acting was good, the story line kept a good pace and plenty of good twists and turns with a nice bit of dark humor thrown in. The end was explosive, so to speak lol. Well made, fun movie! Wish there were more like this out there. Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed."
" Really surprised at any negative reviews - give it a go
",2018-07-02 00:00:00,10,"I've watched Housebound three times now, each with different family members or friends and I really love it. I honestly can't identify or understand the negative reviews I see here. The movie is funny (slapstick and dead-pan); original, it's acted so well and there are twists in the plot I didn't see coming. It's a bit scary in places, so it gets your heart racing, but there is no gore. At the time I write this, the movie is scoring 6.8 / 10 on imbd, but it's one of the most fun movies I've seen in the last four years, I'm really surprised it hasn't scored higher."
" Really enjoyable movie, worth to watch!
",2018-05-19 00:00:00,10,"Both funny, and scary! I really enjoyed it, i found the plot smart and i recommend it!"
" Overrated.
",2018-04-21 00:00:00,4,"No idea how it got such a high rating, maybe because it appeals to casual mainstream audiences who have very low standards and enjoy a few light hearted jokes here and there, to put it simply, it's not funny and it's not scary, unless of course you're a simpleton."
" I know a place we can hide
",2018-03-21 00:00:00,8,"Kylie Renee Bucknell (Morgana O'Reilly) bungles an ATM robbery and gets sentenced to eight months of house arrest in her mother Miriam's (Rima Te Wiata) home. She lives there with Graeme (Ross Harper) a quiet creepy man. She has an ankle bracelet that prevents her from leaving. Mom is convinced the house is haunted and it isn't long before Kylie joins her in the belief dragging in Amos (Glen-Paul Waru) of Titan security. At 43 minutes into the film, we discover the true story about the house and former occupants.The film is 111 minutes long, taking time enough to weave a tale and introduce characters late. The movie is in part a comedy, but there are many scenes which have no humor. The opening scene made me laugh. It is a film worth viewing and one I that I will toss into my keeper pile.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Blood squirting."
" New Zealand Does Disturbia
",2017-10-27 00:00:00,5,"Placed under house arrest, a bitter young woman has trouble convincing others that an intruder or ghostly presence is responsible for mysterious goings-on at her home in this mix of horror, comedy and mystery elements from New Zealand. The film benefits from a superb turn by Rima Te Wiata as the protagonist's superstitious mother who has always believed that her house is haunted but who is more perturbed by her daughter's antisocial behaviour. Glen-Paul Waru has some fun moments too as a local law enforcement officer who believes in the paranormal. The overall film though is less impressive. One of the biggest issues is the frequent genre hopping. The movie jumps between mystery, thriller, horror and comedy mode without ever smoothly blending these elements. Some sections are deadly serious while others are uncannily comedic (fending off a killer with a xylophone) with little consistency throughout. The biggest drawback though is the fact that the film's protagonist is utterly obnoxious. She is such an angry, moody, ungrateful young woman that it is hard to care what happens to her. There are, however, some fun psychobabble moments late in the piece with her shrink suggesting that all the horror is merely in her mind. The house set design is great too, but overall it is hard to watch this film without recalling how much better 'Disturbia' did its similar premise."
" A Surrealistic Sattire
",2017-10-01 00:00:00,8,"👍👍 4/4 **** This's not that sort of movie that is easy to adapt and understand. It is wonderfully packed with such flawless performance of every crew involved in the movie. All the few characters are very well scripted. Why do we watch a movie? To be entertained and we know in the thrill that nothing is real. And later we make such fun of the horrors and mystery we see on screen. But this's such a movie that is already subconsciously make you feel relaxed with its mockery of the entertainment. Gerrard Johnstone is not one of those known directors. He's young and yet intelligent enough to capture the essence of making a movie that is so dark, so thrilling, so emotional and so much sarcastic in such serious scenes. We experience something surreal in the whole movie that needs a little patience to get used to."
" Cool
",2017-09-05 00:00:00,6,"Yeah, it was cool.Would like it better if things turned out to be really supernatural. But this was a cool film to spend the evening. It's worth it. The house shown in the film was perhaps too small to have a secret dungeon - other than that, there was no defect in the film for a common watcher like me."
" Part comedy, part gore, part suspense, not sure what it was.....
",2017-08-08 00:00:00,8,"I watched it because it seemed like it would be a good late night suspense / horror movie. The first part of the movie drags on a bit as the character personalities are presented to us, but things kick in about 40% into the movie and then it gets pretty interesting. The dynamics / personalities of and between the characters in the movie make it an enjoyable watch. The whole time I was trying to figure out if this is supposed to be a horror movie, or a spoof on horror movies. It was certainly bizarre enough to keep me interested, and entertaining enough to keep me chuckling at times. Then towards the end, things really get strange and rather gory, but once again in somewhat of a comical way. So while I overall enjoyed the movie, I'm still a little confused on what the actual genre is."
" surprising bits of fun
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,7,Kylie Bucknell is a troubled girl in New Zealand. She gets arrested for trying to break into an ATM. She is sentenced to house arrest and forced to move back in with her mother Miriam. Miriam suspects the house is haunted. Strange things start to happen. Amos sets up her ankle bracelet and is a paranormal enthusiast. Dennis is the psychologist assigned to her case.There are surprising moments of light humor in this odd little horror. It's not particularly scary. It has a bit of fun like the Cornetto Trilogy. The lead character is not necessarily a nice girl but she still maintains some rooting interest. The story doesn't completely hold together but the last act has plenty of fun.
" Great Little Movie - Just Drop Your Preconceived Notions At the Door
",2017-03-28 00:00:00,10,"This is a great little movie, but you have to accept it for what it is: it's quirky, it's British comedy, and it's also a murder mystery with a smattering of paranormal worked in.If you go into it expecting either a traditional horror film or a traditional comedy, you won't like it. Just sit back, open your mind, and let it pleasantly surprise you. (Yes, it's a little campy here and there, but that's part of the fun)"
" All movies start with a 5/10
",2017-03-14 00:00:00,6,"If there is one thing to say about this film is that it is original. I enjoyed watching the film(On Netflix), It was a different than the creepy house is haunted type horror that floods the cinemas. The screenplay is where this movie shines, Its very well done and had many twists and turns that I never saw coming. Although the movie is good and I found the screenplay well done, The movies has many false scares and a loud score to try an scare you. There are a few scares that are not false but they more help to keep the story going. I just wanted to see where it was going other than scenes that felt repetitive while watching. She does this few scenes later does the same thing, this movie felt longer than needed to make the story. It spoon feeds you information with exposition filled dialogue and explanations to every encounter. Overall I enjoyed the movie but left me with nothing to really think about. I don't think I need to watch it again other than watching it with a friend. It earns a 6/10."
