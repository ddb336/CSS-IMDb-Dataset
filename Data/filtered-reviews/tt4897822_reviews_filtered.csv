" Brilliant Observation
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,9,"The faix outrage from the MAGA crowd who watch this documentary is hysterical. Is it biased? Of course it is, Moore has a liberal agenda, always has and always will. This shouldn't be a surprised to anyone. The point has been lost on many who seem to think Moore is anti-patriotic when the opposite is true. I met Moore once in Ireland and he is one of the most patriotic and positive people I have ever met. He wants whats best for his country, but the alt-right only see him as a gun stealer. Here Moore cherry picks the best bits that some European countries and Tunisia (yes Tunisia, the shining light of democracy) to import them to make the USA better. It's a light hearted and whimsical look at some ideas that are perhaps worth thinking about. For me, Finland and their attitude to education is enlightening. Remove all pressure from kids and they'll flourish."
" Perfect...
",2020-06-29 00:00:00,10,"Completely enchanting, impossible to score less than 10... In thinking that we are a privileged nation, we have 30 days of paid vacation, free health and education, even if precarious, and we realize how bad our education is when we compare it to Finland in the documentary, so simple and effective ... And even our food in public schools, of course they don't reach the feet of France ... Too bad it expired before I could finish ..."
" His best message yet
",2020-02-10 00:00:00,9,Of all of his documentaries this one will make you feel good. The truth doesn't have to be harsh it can be beautiful and inspiring.
" Excellent documentary!!!!
",2020-01-27 00:00:00,10,"Michael Moore travels to europe and picks up the best in every one to take them to america...
EXCELLENT!!!"
" Woman equality
",2019-11-04 00:00:00,7,"Its funny when they talk about woman president, here in argentina we had a woman president who was the worst of the history with corruption, we need equality she have to be in jail, now is again in the goverment. argentina with stupid people who is welcomed."
" First female president is NOT from Iceland
",2019-07-27 00:00:00,7,"The movie claims that the first female president is from Iceland, vigdis finnbogadottir. From 1980.
But Israel had a female prime minister from 69 to 74, Golda Meir."
" America is the greatest country in the world!
",2019-07-17 00:00:00,8,"Yeah... No!
Really.
Just... NO!This movie shows you why and it's mind baffling how somebody with half a brain could really believe this sentence."
" Good but some misleading content
",2019-07-07 00:00:00,6,"I would have given 8 stars, but there was a considerable amount of cherry picked or out of context content. Granted, he could have used totally indefensible alternatives, but he didn't. That screams of bias."
" Capitalism doesn't work....
",2019-01-27 00:00:00,10,This movie should be played then new laws need to be made. We need a leader who truly has our best interest at heart. It won't happen unfortunately. This movie opened my eyes to how much greed exists in the USA
" Worth watching it
",2018-12-10 00:00:00,9,"Similar to the previous film my favorite- capitalism a love story- it makes us face the reality of this world.
The American Dream may not be the dream, see the best practices around Europe. Enjoy it!"
" A tour de force that will leave you with a LOT more knowledge about Europe
",2018-11-07 00:00:00,8,"Michael Moore has come along way since his ""Roger & Me"" days. Aside from his groundbreaking work in The Big One (1997), Moore spent most of his career appealing to Democrats and liberals that want to stir things up...somewhat. However, Moore comes from a strong union background and is one of the few progressive commentators these days willing to tackle issues of economic hardship in addition to the social revolution going on in this country (LGBTQ marriage, metoo movement, blacklivesmatter, etc).Moore's progressive humor, interspersed with archival footage and rock and roll songs is a breath of fresh air. There is always something so very American about his movies. No matter how or what he's criticizing you feel like this is the guy you want to go grab a Big Mac with at the local Cineplex. He's the muckraking everyman.Where To Invade Next? is like a European history and contemporary events course rolled into one (and I mean that in the best way possible!) Through some unique play on ideas, Moore takes us on a trip through several countries, ""borrowing"" key ideas and policies that have proven to be very effective. The end result is that we not only believe a better world as possible, we see it unfolding before our eyes as Moore brings us solutions to problems that can feel insurmountable. In a way, he plays a sort of political ""Puff the Magic Dragon"" - giving wings to our imaginations for progressive ideas we simply thought were impossible. Through that process I found many tear-jerking moments that swelled my heart an extra shoe size (yeah, my heart could wear shoes...psshh!)The film oscillates between a positive contemporary dialogue of European policy, and intense archival footage of the problems here in the states. While I can see this being an important reminder for audiences, I did find it jarring at times. There is one segment in particular where ""uplifting"" music is being played over scenes of prisoner abuse that I found unnecessarily triggering, and somewhat manipulative. I don't personally feel like Moore is deserving of the propaganda label that gets shoveled in his direction at times. However this segment was an exception to that, and fortunately only a small bit in the film.My only other critique of this film is that Moore himself looks like a raggedy old hitchhiker throughout the film...even when meeting the president of a country(!) This comes off as pretty disrespectful, and makes me wonder why a shower and a haircut would be such a bad thing for our lovingly persistent political gadfly. Now that he's internationally famous, he can get away with dressing however he wants but I felt like he took this a bit too far when so many of the places he visits are showing him gratitude and hospitality.I found this movie to be surprisingly uplifting, and incredibly educational. It feels strange to enjoy learning so much from a film, like I took a class I didn't even notice it! I especially enjoyed the history of Iceland and his careful attention to the role of women in different countries.A very solid film you won't regret watching, it will make you laugh, cry, and learn. What more can you ask from a movie? 8/10"
" Some might say....
",2018-10-21 00:00:00,8,"Where to invade next. Michael Moore 'invades' other countries to steal ideas that could make 'The American Dream' a reality. Universal healthcare, free education, paid vacations, equal rights, prisoner rehabilitation rather than retribution etc etc etc. Some might say all loony lefty claptrap, but, whilst unashamedly one-sided, Moore illustrates how the USA (and by association its UK puppet) could and indeed should learn much from the rest of the world. But hey, there's profit to be made from human misery. 7 and a half out of ten."
" The full truth didnt appear
",2018-09-30 00:00:00,4,"I live in Finland, so called happiest country. Where I can get medicines, somekind of apartment or actualla everoyhing if youre a sick and poor ? Answer is nowhere.And the people indeed doesnt look that happy, what Moore showed to us. And like USA, its better to get healthcare from private sector than public places since there arent simply enough work for everybody, sick or healthy. And even if you got work, it doesnt guarantee private sector health.I was frustated by this film, because I expected more truth."
" The ultimate anti american
",2018-08-09 00:00:00,1,Miss Moore goes out of her way to promote her liberal anti American ways in this trash heap dumpster fire. Many times I struggled to figure out if it was Miss Moore I was looking at or Rosie O Donnel
" Moore revives original greatness
",2018-06-17 00:00:00,8,"U.S. Documentarian Michael Moore travels to nine different countries (eight of them in Europe) in order to ""invade"" them i.e. to ""steal"" the best of their social policies and bring them back to the U.S. The ironic conclusion is sad as well as fascinating.Throughout this travelogue, the viewer learns of superior national policies and lifestyles: worker benefits (Italy and Germany), gourmet-like school lunches and open sex education (France), education systems with no homework and concentration on each child's full well-being (Finland), free university tuition even for foreign students (Slovenia), the benefits of fully acknowledging a nation's horrific past (Germany), how the legalization of drugs was followed by reduced drug use (Portugal), prison systems where the prisoners are treated with humanity and trust (Norway), a religious Muslim country that fully supports women's rights including full access to abortion (Tunisia), and how women's participation in banking and political life improves the lot for all (Iceland).This is Moore's best film since ""Bowling for Columbine"" (2002). Since ""Farenheit 911"", he started to go over-the-top and become didactic. In this current film, the preaching is behind and what we see is more of his intelligence, humour, and great skills at unveiling the facts. He has a deep concern for his country and it shows.Some moments are memorable: juxtaposing sound bites of past U.S. presidents condemning other countries' ""barbarisms"" with visual footage of great domestic troubles in the U.S.; one of three Italian CEO siblings failing to understand why someone would want to be richer by giving their workers less money and benefits (she couldn't give up the good relations she had with her staff); the looks of the faces of an Italian couple when they hear that American workers have no guaranteed vacation compared to their minimum of six weeks; a Portuguese drug expert casually comparing drug addiction to other addictions: alcohol, sugar, caffeine, and.......Facebook; an articulate Tunisian woman showing her genuine surprise as to why so many people would watch ""The Kardashians""; and mostly the interview with a Norwegian man who lost his son to the mass murders of 2011. He did not show the desire for vengeance as one might expect.This movie is not without flaws. It's a bit too long at two hours. It also seems to whitewash any of the problems faced by the nine nations. Its claim at the end that we need more women in power is noble to a degree and logical in certain contexts but maybe this principle works better in a socialist society like Iceland than it would in other countries. In the U.S. (as well as my country of Canada), high-ranking female politicians are just as prone to greed and corruption as their male counterparts. This may be so in other countries as well. There is also no mention of the long history of European countries' prejudice against the Roma minority.In the end, this is still a fine documentary and it's great to see Moore back in his best form again."
" Brilliant
",2018-05-30 00:00:00,8,"Thought Provoking movie. You can ask your self, if this country can make this happen why can't we."
" Really Enjoyed This Film...
",2018-04-26 00:00:00,10,"Their were a lot of very interesting point brought to light in the this film. I would hope people would be more opened mined and observant of what works and don't work in society. Great film and very informative, I hope the messages and the information someday lead to a debate to a better way of tackling social and world problems.."
" One of the most honest and most valuable patriotic films that an American has ever recorded
",2018-04-01 00:00:00,10,"""Where to invade next?"" is an expansive, funny and subversive comedy in which the Oscar-winning MM confronts all the burning problems of today's America and finds solutions in strangest places. The creator of films such as ""Fahrenheit 11/9"" and ""Capitalism: A Love Story"" returned with a big movie that is different from everything he has done so far.A call to arms to win and regain the American dream right here in America. One of the most honest and most valuable patriotic films that an American has ever recorded...An optimistic accomplishment based on a challenging, but invaluable idea: we can do better."
" Liberal Spew
",2018-03-29 00:00:00,3,"I gave this film 3 stars for the laughs it evoked. But to view this as a serious documentary is ludicrous. While there were a few legitimate points made in this film, there is no where on earth that is Nirvana. Try exercising free speech in Great Britain or Germany. Hunting in France?...Only if you're rich, and you have to rent the gun from the Government. Every point in this film can have holes poked through it. For example: the first couple he interviewed was a police officer and a buyer for a major retailer. Both high powered (relatively) jobs. How do couples that both work high pay jobs, with no kids, live in the US? Police officers in the US are unionized...High pay, lots of vacation time, and great benefits, plus retirement with full pay and benefits...Can Italy say that? The only difference is that in the US if you have no ambition and are lazy you go nowhere. As it should be. Thanks for reading my rant."
" A great message for what can be achieved, if we want to...
",2017-11-04 00:00:00,8,"Moore, in his classic style, hits hard at the topic in hand; namely American exceptionalism, with a close look at some of the best practices in Europe that are a stark and painful contrast to the USA.Critics, of which I have read many on this site, correctly claim that some of the countries Moore visits are far from perfect, and they even cite some (often irrelevant) examples. What they are ignoring, and this is the essence, is that these programs and practices are working well, for the benefit of the public and/or employees; as well as society as a whole! Other ills are simply problems to be addressed.What this film marvelously does is reveal what we can achieve if we want to, with proof of it working. It's up to us as citizens of our respective countries to decide if our system is better and, if not, how can we make it so - because there are real world examples of great ideas, great people, and great results for all involved.Moore, as ever, shines a light on a problem and offers the hope that there is a solution. The solution is, as ever, in our collective hands. We love in democracies, do we not? Moore reminds us of this, and hopes to nudge us into seeking the change we want through the ballot box. He always knows it's up to us and our conscience, and that's why his films prick our conscience, if we have one."
" Commercial movie trying to make a political point.
",2017-09-19 00:00:00,7,"To take this movie seriously, one has to accept its premise: that other countries, especially European countries, have anything to offer to the United States that's worth learning and adopting. That premise is hard to accept or defend. If anything, the rest of the world relies on the United States to solve problems, not the other way around. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, which occurred four and half decades after Europe ceased being the center of world power, the United States emerged as THE dominant country on the planet. That fact the movie omits. That omission seriously erodes the movie's credibility as a serious social commentary. Instead, Moore seems to revel in his dual role of American tourist/amateur cultural anthropologist. His admiration and interest in other cultures seem superficial and entirely staged, which is not surprising since the movie is not an academic project but rather a commercial product meant for an American audience and meant to promote a political agenda. This movie is another example of a movie maker using entertainment to make a political point. The formula certainly is not a new one. Whether it works in this case is up to the audience to decide."
" propaganda
",2017-09-07 00:00:00,1,"This movie is pure propaganda. Moore has taken one little segment from each of these countries and expanded upon it. In France are we given to understand that all the Schools in that country serve gourmet meals ? Hogwash. In Italy are all the companies giving their employees eight weeks vacation ?? I'm sure Fiat doesn't. 21 years for murdering more than 50 people, mostly children. Absurd. Does he want the US to change to that form of injustice ?? Then he shows his dementia, when coming out of a meeting with the president of SLOVENIA he refers to it as SLOVAKIA."
" More distorted propaganda
",2017-08-01 00:00:00,2,"I liked the first Moore film on Flint, MI but he has always started with left wing propaganda and shows that his films are just extensions of Pravda like journalism and its orientation to 'capitalism'. Yet Russia and China are becoming more capitalist, while still regaining control over the people in social interactions.His comment, ""slaves built this country"" is just like Obama saying 'you didn't build this country, we did"". The leftist theology never ends.So, Michael who paid the wages of workers. Capitalist, people willing to invest cash into major projects like railroads, buildings, early roads, cars, electricity... forgot about that did you? Did workers say, 'hey let's build cars' or did they earn a living from capital investment.But yes wages were indeed low and it was Henry Ford to doubled their wages so that every worker could buy a Ford, something that only the RICH, like Moore, could afford. And labor unions were necessary in the 1900.He also fails to mention (on purpose) that there was a Trans-Atlantic slave trade, most were run by African tribal leaders who sold slaves and that of some 10 million slaves, 4 million went to Brazil and the rest of Central and South America. and some 450,000 Africans in the US for the slave trade.Moore just simply distorts facts and cherry picks and uses the sin of omission to 'prove' his left wing narrative bias.Sadly his films profit from paranoia, conspiracy theory and duplicity."
" Not That Interesting
",2017-07-29 00:00:00,4,"This documentary (or mockumentary) was interesting in some parts, but is really nothing more than cherry picked questions and responses from Michael Moore. It was touted as a provocative comedy, but I found it to be seldom provocative or humorous. The movie did its best to point out flaws and possible solutions to problems in the United States by interviewing people from different nations. The interviewees were asked about how drug control was handled, how prisons were, etc., and then those nations' systems were placed in stark contrast to the penal and judicial systems of the United States. The movie had a few good points here and there, yet I feel it missed the mark as meaningful entertainment. It came off to me as a hagiography of the liberal purview. Yes, the US has many problems, but we also have demographics that have changed drastically over the years. I feel that the US is similar to Brazil, which has similar problems with violence and things of those nature.It's easy to look at history and view it as bad people with power oppressing those without power. It's more objective to just say that this is how it is versus this is how it used to be. I think that people like Michael Moore forget how bad things WERE and willfully ignore the good changes that have occurred. Anyway, this is one Moore doc that I'm definitely not a fan of."
" Dear Michael Moore, this is all not true...
",2017-05-06 00:00:00,3,Dear Michael Moore I live all my live in Europe and started to think if I've missed something in here... I hope with this documentary will get the situation in the US better. In company's people have to listen don't get to say a lot. In Europe you get discriminated on religious and cultural bases. They all say that they treat you as the same until you ask them this very same question when they had a drink or two...
" Interesting...
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,7,"First, Michael Moore is still an idiot. But, this documentary was recommended to me by someone I trust dearly, so thought I would give it a shot. ***Warning, regardless of political views and level of patriotism, if you have thought about leaving the country because of how ridiculous the United States has become, then do not watch this. It might just push you over the edge to leave and finder greener pastures***No need to go into a full review here, but this is a well done documentary even though Michael Moore still makes outlandish claims against the United States with very little or no evidence to back it up. He does crack me up through the documentary as he carries an American Flag with him the entire time, and whenever he has an idea he wants to bring back he just posts it in the ground. Any way, thought provoking, entertaining, and I think I'm moving to Italy or Germany..."
" Brilliant but biased
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,8,"This review will contain spoilers!You will in this movie follow Michael Moore's quest around the world for ideas that other countries developed to a greater extent than the Americans. The thoughts he highlights are for example how many weeks of paid vacation the Italians get, Portugal's laws around drug use, teenage pregnancies 'sin France, Norway's view on imprisonment and Finland's school system, but also more. In my opinion Michael Moore did a good job and caught my attention by bringing up these subjects above, but are his statements in the film true or does he have a hidden agenda and wants to change people's minds? Research shows that Italians don't get 8-9 weeks of paid vacation per year. On the contrary, at most, they get six whole weeks of paid vacation per year. This proves that Michael Moore's assertion is false (http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/lwp/papers/No_Holidays.pdf). Michael Moore indicates that France's adolescent fertilities are fewer than in America, and from what I found, there is ample support for this. 2015, teenage pregnancies within the ages 15 to 19 were in America 32 per 1000 and in France 9 per 1000. (http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.ADO.TFRT? end=2015&locations=FR&start=2015&view=bar) Studies also shows results of how the pregnancy rate has decreased in both countries since 2011. In France the number has decreased with 64 percent and in the United States with 44 percent. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4852976/table/T1/#TFN5 ) It is still important to realize that Michael Moore wants to make a statement with the content of the documentary. For this reason he might twist the truth to get empathy, but this is not one of those cases. The fact that the pregnancy rate is much lower in France is true, nonetheless Moore's contention that it has to do with the different ways to talk about sex doesn't have to be. All things considered, I believe that this is a documentary worth watching. On one hand he shows various thoughts in different countries which, at least in my case, made me more curious about the priorities and the citizen's positive attitude to them. On the other hand it's a great film to reflect on and it contains subjects to be critical about, with its interesting meaning expressed in a funny and eye-catching way. To conclude, I would strongly recommend this documentary to everyone, as long as they keep in mind to be critical."
" Interesting but deluding
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,3,"Where to invade next is a documentary produced by Michael Moore and was released in late 2015. The documentary is about how Michael Moore (the producer and writer of the documentary) travels all around Europe to find ideas from different European countries, which he can later on bring back to the United States to make the United States more like Europe. Michael utilizes humor to show and describe a complex problem to his viewers in a simple way. But in my opinion too much humor can be very deceiving and as a viewer you can miss the importance of the subject. Michael Moore is an extremely good producer and writer. He's really talented and knows exactly how to catch someone's attention in his new documentary ''Where to invade next''. Although Michael knows what he's doing, he has a tendency to be a lot one-sided. This makes me question almost everything he says in the documentary'. It's my assertion that Michael Moore doesn't show us the whole truth, only what looks good on television. This makes me question if I really can believe everything that Michael tells us, or if he is just angling the facts again? And if so, why?In his documentary he compares the United States with Europe and according to me, Michael presents a picture of how awful the United States is and tells us how Europe is superior in almost every sense. Michael show us how different some parts of the United States are as compared to Europe and in my own naive world I did not believe that the gap between Europe and the United States was that big. What I perceived from the documentary was that the people in Europe and in the United States pays almost the same in taxes. The difference is that the United States choose to use the tax income to finance the military instead of focusing on free healthcare, free college degrees and education for every child. So I agree with Michael Moore on one point: We both want free healthcare, free college degree and education for everyone. So, to summarize, in my opinion Michael utilizes in a humorous way an important issue and puts light on the big differences between the United States and the countries that he visits in Europe. Differences in respect to one and another , gender equality, working conditions and free college degrees. Despite the importance of the documentary it's also very important to question the content, when Michael unilaterally describes the subject. What I want to bring about to you, the reader, is the importance of being critical."
" Where to invade next - Review
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,6,"Where to invade next? – Review*This will contain spoilers*I've just watched the documentary ""where to invade next by?"" Michael Moore (2015). A well know director and author with other well-known documentaries. He is also known to have strong political view in his documentaries (liberal) which sometimes make his work a bit biased. Now I will tell you my opinion about the documentary.In this movie Mike is invading a bunch of European countries with the goal to steal some useful ideas for him to bring back home. He travels all around Europe and speaks to politicians, polices, teachers and so on. During his trip to Europe he only found good things to bring back to America, surprisingly. For example the vacation system in Italy, the food served in school cafeterias in France and the prison system in Norway. He is really questioning the way America is governed and praises the way many countries in is governed.In my point of view this documentary is a very biased one. He only shows the bad thing in every country and only the bad things from America. Like all of Europe is so great and America really hasn't got anything to offer the world. Also as I said in my introduction, he is a political activist and that his work can be a bit biased. According to me, if you are a producer for documentaries that is watched worldwide by so many people in many different ages you have to be unbiased, show different views and opinions. Even though it is very biased I have to give it to him that he is very good at proving his points and making people agreeing with him. A bad thing about this is also that he makes people believe in things that isn't really completely true. If you take the Italian vacation system for example, Michael says that the Italian gets 8 weeks of paid vacation every year, but is that really true? According to www.lifeinitaly.com and http://knowledge.leglobal.org/ a minimum of 4 weeks paid vacation is given and I really doubt there are many companies that double that time, nothing is said about that giving more weeks is common. Michael also says that there is no homework in Finland and that's also a false statement, in fact they have homework but not as much as in other countries. This is stated in many reliable Swedish newspapers such as svd.se and dn.se. Having this said I don't think you should believe everything said by him before double- checking. To conclude I would said it is a well-produced documentary if you are looking at what he wants to show us, even though it's very biased. I would not really recommend for educational way when you are learning about politics in the United States of America or Europe because of the way Michael only shows one side and sometimes he also hides the entire truth. But when you are learning about criticism of sources it's very useful. So I will rate the movie 6 out of 10. Thanks for reading!"
" Michael Moore compare USA to other countries
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,8,"This review will contain spoilers.Where to invade next was released in 2015 in Canada and United States of America and three months later they released it for the rest of the world. Michael Moore who wrote and directed this movie is back with another funny documentary that will for sure make you laugh but also show you the differences between USA and some other countries.This documentary is produced by Michael Moore, he's traveling around the world to conquer the best ideas and concepts and bring them back to the US. He does this in order to make a better society in the US. In the film he is traveling to places such as Italy, France, Tunisia, Slovenia, Portugal and Norway to find out if the working conditions, school lunches, gender equality etc.. are better there and why it's better. But this movie is extremely misleading if you believe that just because one school have nice food doesn't mean the entire country has the same quality. It's simply impossible. Likewise, the statement that Germany have so good working condition can't be confirmed unless other sources can back it up. He portrays Europe as if we don't have any flaws at all and that's totally wrong, every country has their flaws but he doesn't show the entire picture and that makes the film really unreliable. So what can we call it? A documentary or propaganda?But, I really loved the film because of the humor in it but also that it's so serious. Everybody should see the movie and judge it for themselves. I'm sure you will learn something fun, but also a lot of interesting facts you didn't knew about those countries earlier. I guess Michael Moore also has a hidden reason behind this movie. He wants us to discuss and talk to each other about it and the differences between the countries.I highly recommend this movie."
" Where to invade next is a documentary about Michael Moore when he's travelling to Europe to explore and find useful ideas that he's going to bring back to the USA.
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,6,"This review will contain spoilers.I have watched the documentary ""where to invade next"" made by Michael Moore (2015). Michael Moore is a well-known director and political activist who have done other documentaries with a political aim that America has flaws that they should consider taking more serious and learn more about to become a better country. This documentary is about how and why other countries in Europe are better than America. Michael is during the documentary travelling around in different countries to find useful ideas that will further the United States. According to me, this is more of a propaganda movie than a documentary because I believe that when he visit countries like Italy, Norway and Tunisia he is just talking about the good things in their country and compare it to the bad in the USA which doesn't reflect the political situation or each countries welfare in either Europe or in the USA in the right way, because there are flaws in every country and not only in the USA, so the documentary is very biased. To put it in differently his information is also very misleading. He pronounce that in the schools of Finland they doesn't have any homework at all and that's one of the reasons why they have a higher level on their students and why they perform better than the pupils in America. But reported by two reliable newspapers from Sweden (http://www.dn.se and https://www.svd.se ) the students in Finland still have homework, but it's not as much as they have in America. That means that Moore is stating something false when he say that they don't have any homework at all, even if what he is trying to say is that students shouldn't have to dig into a lot of homework immediately after getting home from a long day in school. This is just one example but it's a reason to search if everything he says is exaggeratedly and if he's telling the truth or not. At the same time it's a bit impressive that he does documentaries like this because it gets attention and people do listen to him and he's making a clear point of what he's showing. In other words he is reaching out in the way he wants to, he want people to believe in what he says and that's something to respect. In conclusion I think that it's a well-made movie, the motive of the movie is shown very clear and he does it very well by showing his point, but why my rate will be lower is because of his way of just showing one side of all countries that he visited. People will either trust the things that is said or not, some people may be critical. I would only recommend this movie to people that is critical or want to learn to be critical. I would not show this movie in educational purpose for learning about other countries. I give the documentary 6 out of 10."
" Don't forget to be critical!
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,8,"This review will contain spoilers!Michael Moore is a filmmaker who is great at catching people's attention when it comes to documentaries. He is very smart and knows what to point out and what to remove from the movies. What he is doing is that he is only presenting one perspective. In my opinion, the documentary ""Where to invite next"" is very interesting and useful because it shows what other countries like U.S. can learn from the countries in the movie. But, it requires that you are critical and don't get fooled and fall for everything because we don't know what he is withholding from us. To be honest, I think the movies directed by Michael Moore are in general fun to watch and therefore I often get so into them that I forget to think critically. Even though most of what's in the movie may be true, it's important to realize that it may be biased. In like manner, he is not always displaying us everything, only the pieces that fit him.Don't misunderstand me, this documentary is well done according to me. It's just that we have to think about the information he is conveying and what he is concealing about the countries. It's easy to believe that everything about these countries is amazing and that America has a lot to work on, just because that's what we have been shown in the documentary. In similar fashion, we haven't seen anything great about America just because he wants us to be unaware of those things. To clarify, it doesn't mean that everything in America is useless just because he is hiding the good. We know that Michael Moore has been critical of America before, and with his movies, he is able to get followers on that.I don't assert that he is lying about everything, but neither does he bring the whole truth. For instance, when he was in Italy he only visited the two factories known to be the best in the country in terms of working conditions and the number of paid holidays. I can guarantee that it's not like that in every factory in Italy. So to keep in mind, just because he examined two factories it doesn't mean that every factory is similar. It's also far away from everyone in Italy that has 8 weeks paid holiday. It was just one lucky couple out of the 60 million Italian residents. Research clearly suggests that statutory minimum annual leave is 4 weeks, plus 13 paid public holidays. (http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/lwp/papers/No_Holidays.pdf page 3)As has been noted, all of his assertions can't be trusted without research. Although this is a smart way to persuade people that U.S. has a lot to learn. Be that as it may, but we can compare some great matters in America with less positive things in other countries. But in this case, he has singled out one specific thing in each country that is characteristic for them, and compares that with America. What if he would have picked great things about America instead? Maybe these countries wouldn't do as well. To summarize, don't forget to be critical!"
" Highly biased and deceptive
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,4,"This review will contain spoilers!Where to invade next is directed by and starring Michael Moore who is back with another U.S. critical documentary. While this time comparing European countries, pointing out their strengths and comparing them to his homeland's weaknesses. Even though this film is labeled as a documentary, I'm ready to disagree with this claim. Throughout the film Moore gives a deceptive view of both USA and European countries. By describing USA as an ignorant, cruel and horrible country in chaos and at the same time glorying Europe with false statements the viewer of the movie will be confused and get the wrong picture of how the situation is in the world. The first country Michael Moore decides to visit is Italy, a place where the working conditions are marvelous, with a minimum of 2 hours' lunch, 8 week paid vacation a year and happy workers as far as you can see. But is this really the reality? The answer is obviously no. The truth is Italians are entitled to a maximum of 20 paid vacation days + 10 paid holidays (http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/06/08/countries- most-vacation-days/2400193/), which in total adds up to 31 days, or 6 weeks. Even though 6 weeks is a relatively long time as paid vacation, Moore still chooses to exaggerate which gives a false impression of the working conditions. He also visits France, where a clip of a school chef claims he has never tasted a hamburger, and the kids at school are afraid of Coca- Cola, despite the fact that France has the second highest profitability for McDonalds in the world, besides USA. (http://www.dn.se/ekonomi/snabbmatskedjan-mcdonalds-inte-valkommen- i-Paris-matmekka/)He also visits Tunisia, where he praises the gender equality. He reminds us that the government funds woman-clinics and abortion, but not so surprisingly forgets to mention that the country is in 126th place on World Economic Forum's gender gap list. They also include a clip where a former leader of the government explain that the government can't force a woman to wear head coverings, which sounds great, until he continues with explaining that instead he himself is the one to tell his wife to do that. It's ironic that Moore decides to even bring gender equality up, since it's more of an issue than something to brag about in Tunisia. If he wanted to feature a country in Europe who has achieved more gender equality, he could have chosen Iceland, Norway or Finland, who are the top three most gender equal countries. To summarize, this film is highly biased and only created to make USA look bad in in comparison to Europe. Michael Moore uses false information to fool the viewers and throughout the movie he disparages USA as a country. The idea of a film who compares different countries is great but the way the director chooses to edit and give information is wrong in all ways. I would definitely not recommend this movie due to its lack of credibility. If I were to rate the movie it would get a 4 out of 10. The film deserves 4 stars because of the good sense of humour it contains and the way the movie was produced."
" A documentary with a mixture of humor and various perspectives
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,5,"This review will contain spoilers!The movie Where to invade next was produced in 2015 and is directed by a film-maker and political activist named Michael Moore. He travels the world to learn from others and to find information to be able to build up what's supposed to be ""the American dream"" of how their citizens want to live. I assert that it can be helpful to visit other nations to gain experience from for example their traditions and laws, but just because Michael Moore insists that these are the ways other countries handle their problems, doesn't necessarily mean that everything has to be true. Therefore, even though the movie is full of interesting statements, it's being discussed whether it's a documentary or a propaganda. Despite that, there's no doubt that Michael Moore manages to account for some of America's biggest flaws. The US is supposed to be the place where dreams come true, nevertheless they have enormous problems within the country that affects the way people are living. It's important that Moore emphasizes these issues, but on the other hand, he only shows the bright sides. Instead of just pointing out the problems you must explain and provide information of how you can develop, which Michael Moore doesn't. There so much more than meets the eye than what Moore mentioned and I'm sure that the average of the people in this film exaggerated a lot, for example when the French chef claimed that he'd never eaten a hamburger. As mentioned earlier, this movie contains many doubtful assertions. For example, in Tunisia, we get the information that the government pays for women clinics and abortions. But what Moore doesn't mention is that Tunisia is on the 126dh place when it comes to equality according to Global Gender Gap 2016, compared to The U.S on the 45th place. Amnesty (http://www.amnesty.se/om- amnesty/kalendarium/handelse/1433/) also claims that it's legal for rapists to marry their victims to escape their punishment, so why would Michael Moore insist that America should be more like Tunisia? It cannot be stressed enough that Tunisia has to work on their gender equality, therefore I don't understand why Michael Moore would use it as a comparison. Michael Moore also managed to offer somewhat misleading information when it came to Italy and their paid vacations. According to USA Today, Italy has 20 vacation days and 10 paid holidays. Although this is not egregious in terms of international comparisons, it's still untrue to state that everyone has eight weeks of guaranteed paid vacation. Why would Michael Moore choose to show false statements about a country instead of selecting one from the beginning that has true facts and more paid vacations than Italy? To summarize, this movie is, in my opinion, very interesting even though it has a lot of uncertain statements. However, it appears to me that the movie-maker chose to exclude all of the negative parts and only show the pros instead of the reality. Of course the solutions that Moore advocated can work and be helpful, but at the same time, every nation has its own problems. Why not show the viewers the reality instead of distorted facts? Nonetheless, it was a relatively good movie with a mixture of humor and various perspectives. I do not recommend this film if you want trustworthy information, but somehow it serves as an eye-opener because it introduces you to other cultures and lifestyles. Therefore, I rate this movie 5 out of 10 points."
" Where To Invade Next
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,7,"""Where to invade next?"" is a documentary by Michael Moore and it was made in 2015. Michael Moore is a political activist and film maker from USA and travel to different countries to learn about them and see what makes the country good. Some people discuss whether or not this is a documentary or if it is propaganda. I think it could be somewhere in the middle, partly a documentary and partly a propaganda movie. In my opinion it is good that he makes a documentary to let the viewers see the difference between the United States and Europe, but why does he only show the good things and not some bad things with the countries he is visiting. He should show the viewers both sides and not only one of them. In my view the countries that he was visiting aren't that good. I have not been to all of the countries but because he doesn't show us the things they don't do well but we can't be sure. For example, in France they make the school lunch look and taste good. I think that the children are more likely to eat it and then they will get better grades if the lunch looks, tastes and smells good. In Sweden there are lots of children that don't eat the food because it doesn't look and smell tasty. ""You shouldn't judge a book by its cover"", it is the same thing with food. It doesn't have to look and smell good to taste good. In the documentary he told us that the people in Italy have eight weeks paid vacation. He was at a company called Ducati and asked they if they had eight weeks of paid vacation and of course they had that. But does everyone in Italy get eight weeks paid vacation? I had to look it up and according to http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/06/08/countries- most-vacation-days/2400193/ they have approximately 30 days of paid vacation. That is four weeks, it is half of what he said in the documentary. He didn't say specifically that all in Italy have eight weeks but he didn't specify that not everyone have eight weeks. To conclude I think you should watch this documentary, but you have to be critical. It was very interesting and fascinating!"

",2017-02-14 00:00:00,2,"This is a review of the documentary ''Where to Invade Next'' (2015), by Michael Moore. This review will contain spoilers. In the documentary Moore ''invades'' some different countries in Europe. Here he shows things those countries has successfully brought in to their society, things he believe the U.S needs to improve in. He asks people how and why they are doing it this way, then he ''conquer'' these ideas and brings them back to America. In the end he reveal that all these ideas are from the beginning from USA and the European countries has just borrowed them from the U.S. The arguments that Michael Moore presents is according to me biased. He only shows the positive sides of the European countries and also leave out important information, not all that he says is true. Everyone hasn't 8 weeks of paid vacation in Italy and not all schools in France has great food, but this things strengthens Moore 's arguments and that's why he puts them in the film anyway. Of course he wants to deliver a message to the audience, he believe that the United States have some issues they need to work with and for all I know he might be right. But for me, the problem in this movie isn't whether or not he is right, but how he convince the audience of it. It is in my opinion not right to present a misleading picture of both the European countries and of the U.S. The people needs to have an honest chance to choose what to believe and then they must know the truth. To summarize, I think that this documentary is biased and Michael Moore isn't showing the whole truth. If you want to see this documentary you need to be critical to Moore's arguments. This isn't a documentary, it is propaganda. I wouldn't recommend this movie because it can give you a wrong and misleading picture of the world."
" Where to invade next
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,7,"Where to invade nextI'd have seen a documentary by Michael Moore, where to invade next. This documentary began to appear in the US 2015. So it is a pretty new documentary. This review will contain spoilers so if you're not will read a review with spoilers so go to an another review without spoilers. In my view this is a documentary that really opens up your eyes for a lot of things all around the world, you defiantly going to compare your priorities from country against these countries in the documentary for example Italy, Norway, Iceland, Finland. The documentary is based on true facts, but we discussed in our class that some of the assertions that actually are untrue. It proves that Michael Moore wants to show the bad side of the US and maybe irritated the American inhabitant to attract people to look at it, because of getting more views. It can be a reason but it's a very bad and different reason to get viewers. The documentary can be good for the American inhabitants, Politian's to, because to see how the rest of the world have for work and life conditions and maybe take after to make America great on some points. Finnish schools in the documentary have no homework's and no standardized tests because to make the children's life's much easier to have contact with friends and family on leisure time. It doesn't is correct that they don't have nothing of this in schools, without they have small homework's and shorter days. This is evidence that some of Michael Moore's arguments not are based sometimes, and want to make US to look very bad for us that not lives there. Then he went to Slovenia. Slovenia provides free collage to everyone which attract many American's too went for because the US collage is very expansive. It's something that Us should work on, they lost massive inhabitant and reputation to countries that have such of good human's spectrum and always want to help in hard situations. This is why US have such a bad reputation for their bad school system, it's to expansive and you may have good school motivation for their homework's and that stuffs. You need to have much time at home to do this and you have not much leisure time.To summery, The documentary is worth to see and you get a look at the different between the countries and what opportunities countries all over the world have to their inhabitants. You get a weird view on US but in some points he is a little bit excessive and is not always right in certain situations. But overall the documentary is very good and Michael Moore is a very good director of this sorts of documentary."
" Astounding with a bit of humour
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,9,"I've watched the documentary ''Where to invade next'', made by Michael Moore, released in 2015. The documentary is about different countries around the world, mostly in Europe, that Moore visits to ''invade'' and to collect ideas which he can bring back to the U.S. For example, he inspected the cafeteria in French schools, interviewed Italians about paid vacation and he got a tour in Norwegian prisons. Moore flew to Island to see how their economic situation looked like, because they stand out from the rest of the countries. What he then found out surprised Moore, and I think every watcher was mind blown on different levels, and you got something important to think about. Before Moore visited Island, he had already invaded Finland. Finland is one of the top countries in terms of academic performance. Moore wanted to see how they managed to be one of the best, considering the size of the country. What he heard when he had a nice chat with some of the teachers in a finish school, shocked him. In the documentary, Moore also invaded Germany, Portugal, Slovenia and Tunisia. He's looked for qualities in each country that make them one of a kind. He compared them all to the U.S, and it's almost like he has an intention to depict the U.S as a lousy country. I don't think he has a political reason for his documentary but I think he has a hidden agenda to represent Europe like heaven, and the U.S as the worst country in the world to live in. When Moore showed images of what a school lunch could look like, or how the circumstances in U.S prisons are like, he presented it as it is worse than the conflict in Syria or the conditions in Saudi Arabia. In my opinion, the documentary was marvelous and really interesting. It have never crossed my mind that Finland doesn't have homework, or that Iceland had the first female president in world history. He covered every big problem our society has today, like inequality between men and women, unhealthy food and plummeting grades in schools . He showed us that we all have what it takes to improve our country superfluous, if we all put in some effort to solve these problems. But I am rather a bit skeptical about the film on the whole. In my view, it is half a documentary, and half a propaganda. It is a propaganda based on that he only accounted for the good things in Europe and Tunisia, while he only showed honestly terrible stuff in the U.S. But at the same time, everything he showed in his movie, Europe has developed and come a long way with, comparing to Moore's homeland. So yes, maybe the director of ''Where to invade next'' didn't portray the U.S as a fantastic country, because they are actually behind on things like healthy lunches, welfare system, crime rates and gender equality. The U.S presents itself as the biggest and strongest country in the world, while they are actually falling behind on basic rights like free school tuition."
" Where to invade next
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,7,"Where to invade next? This review includes Spoilers This documentary was made by a guy named Michael Moore. This documentary is about when Michael Moore are travelling to countries in Europe and steal some ideas what USA can improve and what they can do better. He is trying to make school better in USA and stuffs like that and why countries in Europe are so kind to their prisoners. He is trying to get USA great but he always talking about the bad things in USA. I think that Michael Moore are making very much up and he is always talking about the bad things about USA and he never talking about the bad things like for an example Italia. He is talking about everything good in the country and never the bad things, We don't know if these guys that Michael had interviewed if they had said something bad about their country because he maybe have edited a lot. The majority of the citizens i think have like 5 weeks' vacation and its impossible that everyone has 8 weeks of vacation. I think that Michael has made Europe like a dream continent to live in but he never mentioned any of the bad things in Europe it's just like everything in Europe is astonishing. He is very misleading in his arguments and saying thing that is not actually true. He is trying to tell people like for an example France has the best school food in the world and they are probably not drinking Coca Cola. I assume that they probably drinking Cola outside the school. In my assertion I probably assume that not every school in France has so good school lunch as that kids in the documentary. To come to a conclusion I think that this documentary is pretty good but I think that Michael Moore is a little bit overreacting and he is against everything that has to with USA and even that he is misleading. In my opinion I think that this documentary includes many confusing arguments and he is hating USA to much. USA has many good things like the army and such. He has never mentioned some good stuffs about Untied States. So to say that everything is bad in USA is not actually true. He is making up Europe like a dream continent to live in. But overall a pretty good documentary with many interesting opinions and conclusions in the documentary. I think that Michael Moore is a interesting person although he has very strange opinions and hating on USA. But after all I would rate this documentary 7/10."
" Interesting and fun but the facts are very handpicked
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,6,"Michael Moore is back with his usual controversial and intriguing  documentaries or can we really call it that? In this documentary he  travels to Europe to investigate why some countries does really good in  some social aspects or other categories. He compares ideas about  example, school lunch, prisons, college, vacation, economy and more. He  then makes the claim that he will take the ideas back to the States and  try to make USA adopt these ideas.   The documentary is interesting and it's spreading information that you  might not know, but in my assertion the documentary gives an ignorant  perspective of Europe and the States. Sure it shows Europe's best  sides, but only that. It doesn't show any of the other facts about the  European countries that he visits, he focuses and emphasizes  exclusively on a few things the country is doing well. That isn't wrong  because that's the point of the movie, to show the great things some  Europeans do. Since he only shows one side of the coin makes his  arguments a little flawed. He portrays Europe as if Europe doesn't have  any flaws. Europe is of full flaws, every country has its own problems  and he decides to show everything bad in US but not a single bad thing  in Europe. He does not show the entire picture.  In conclusion. The movie is good but lacks some of the important facts  and views. He shows what can be improved in the US which is good but  not what can be improved in Europe. He is a little biased in the movie.  He's very anti USA. Would I recommend it to someone else? Absolutely,  it brings up many great things that people can learn from, but I would  recommend to be critical when you watch this movie."
" Required viewing for every American.
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,10,"This was much more than a ""movie"" or a ""documentary."" It was enlightenment on film. And yet, even more than that, it was an INDICTMENT of the entire American system... its system of welfare, war, education, health care, and crime prevention. Who would believe that such tiny, seemingly insignificant countries like Finland would so far surpass our failing public educational system, which reduces our young students to nothing more than lifelong slaves to the corporate bankers who support them, or that SLOVENIA would actually teach American students, in English, FOR FREE, and on a level unsurpassed in America?? I very nearly cried, watching the children of Finland actually ENJOYING their childhoods, learning not only to be supremely well educated, but actually HAPPY, the espoused goal of the Finnish school principal Moore actually interviewed. These kids still have physical education, they still have classes in art, music, and literature, and the rich and poor go to school together, insuring that EVERYONE gets an equal education, regardless of social station, while benefiting from the experiences of both. In fact, just watching the utter surprise on MM's face when making discovery after discovery on how other countries conduct their businesses and lives compared to that of other nations, and the utter lie of what the United States has become... a cesspool of government corruption on the highest level, misappropriating vital taxpayer funds to bloody wars of corporate profit, the dumbing down of America, a crumbling of our entire infrastructure as we exploit the both the youth and Middle Class of our own citizenry, was a revelation. This is ""must see"" viewing, by anyone interested in how we desperately need to change our worldview, methods, and our entire paradigm of Profit over People."
" An Optimistic look at a progressive future
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,8,"It's been a tough year. It feels like the whole world's coming to a head. We've spun ourselves up into this mindset where solutions to the problems ahead of us seem insurmountable. It's been a year of bleak documentaries telling us how little control we actually have over our lives. Consciousness itself has been hijacked! I suppose coming from that recent mindset, I watched this documentary with a massive grain a salt burning a hole in my cheek. Every positive, progressive idea it laid before me I had this part of my mind saying, yeah what AREN'T you showing me? Where are the impoverished Italians? How do they live? Well of course Norwegians get along, it's a tiny insular country. Show me the real trauma! Who suffers for these people to live so well!!? Is it strange that that's what I've come to expect from all reality? Maybe it's an American thing.The film seems purposefully obtuse and optimistic in a very propagandistic way, and yet, I couldn't help but have my optimistic side piqued just a bit. It's this weird feeling that says to me, things can get better, and it's not that far out of reach. I came away from it feeling hopeful and full of a dumb sense of populist power. I gotta do something about it!"
" OMG it is so good that I cried!
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,10,"Spoiled content! I am not the biggest fan of Moore but normally check out his work as they seem to be interesting. I know he has this documentary in 2015 and people told it is great until tonight that I have realised--it is beyond that. It is brilliant! The way he locate the time-line and review and comparison state policy is amazing, thou it is one side of the coin. Every country has their own rotten tomato to deal with but there are some good things deserving take as model. I love the word of the journalist from Tunisia 'If you think you are the best, you will stop curious', I cannot memorize exact dialogue thou, it is true--so true. It inspired me to think that you can love your nation but nationalism can be problematic. LOVE IT! LOVE IT! especially the end-- 'We all have the power to go back.' The beginning can be better in some context."
