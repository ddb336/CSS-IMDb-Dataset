" Unfunny comedy.
",2021-03-31 00:00:00,4,"For a comedy, this is pretty damn boring. Didn't laugh once - dialogue is like the screenwriter's diary. It did make me wish I was living on a college campus in 1980 in a carefree world where sex, drugs, baseball and the discotech is all that mattered. The production design, costumes and hair/makeup is Oscar-worthy, and a great soundtrack. Best things about it."
" Didn't age well...
",2021-03-10 00:00:00,1,"I am by no means part of the ""woke mob"" nor would I ever give a bad review because I took offense to something in a film. Thay being said, Linklater's ""dazed and confused"" writing style just didn't age well. I'm a huge Dazed and Confused fan, I thought Boyhood was ambitious yet quite dull, and now this. This awful, sorry excuse for a frat house film. It had no point, horrible acting, weak writing, and absolutely no redeeming qualities. Granted, I didn't finish it, so I guess it's possible that there's a huge plot twist and the film gets better in the last 20 minutes, but that's a long shot. Save yourself the time and pass on this one.."
" Boring and annoying in equal measure
",2021-02-25 00:00:00,1,"A film which is uncritically nostalgic about a group of violent, bigoted fratmen who have no knowledge or interests beyond objectifying women, smoking weed and being homophobic.Like most Linklater films, there's absolutely no plot. But unlike the excellent 'Before' trilogy, there's no charm or thought behind any of it. It's merely a pointless, rambling street of entitlement and machismo."
" Good movie
",2020-12-21 00:00:00,8,"The movie plot is rather simple but all characters are real, well played and are combined organically. While I could not directly relate to any of the characters or even simpathise, I found myself intrigued by their actions and was in suspense to find out how the story will be played out. If you are over 30, there is something nostalgic about the atmosphere. I would not classify the movie as a comedy!"
" Everybody Wants... a plot
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,2,"Great music, good visuals (old cars, clothes, album covers, etc.), absolutely no plot.Some guy the viewer isn't invested in, gets kicked off the team. We later find out because he's too old. (Yawn) Some other guy is a dickhead, but we don't know why. Another one is philosophical, but we don't know why. One guy is crazy, but we don't know why. They're baseball players but other than one batting practice, we never see them play. They're in college but only one knows how to talk to girls. Yawn, yawn, yawn. It's like someone tried to write a sequel to Dazed and Confused and failed miserably.But it's still 2 hours well spent just to see how many late 1970s and 1980 songs they can gratuitously cram into one movie."
" 1980 college life was way better than this
",2020-09-03 00:00:00,4,"Was hoping this would be as good as ""Dazed and Confused""....sadly disappointed. I was a HS freshman in 1976, college freshman in 1980, so was waiting for this to be better. An hour into it, and I'm still waiting for it to get interesting....or for anything to happen.They got the music, the clothes, the cars right...and it's still dull. And the guys' wigs are distractingly terrible.This should've been a much better trip down memory lane."
" What a waste of time
",2020-08-23 00:00:00,2,This film is slow and boring. What a waste of time. It has absolutely no point at all.
" Great
",2020-08-21 00:00:00,9,I never want to this to end amazing movie and what a cast no mistake
" Hilarious, witty and intelligent
",2020-07-07 00:00:00,10,"Everybody wants some is all about living in the moment and taking pride in everything you do. The film is able to showcase this through a college baseball team a few days before they start class.Competitiveness, learning your place within a team, respecting your elders, comradeship are all things you need in a winning sports team and this is made evident throughout the film through various pranks and competitive games.In every scene the characters are always doing something such as smoking weed, drinking, playing pool, dancing, this keeps the action moving and makes the scene alive. In addition the dialogue is witty and refreshing.It's excellently directed because linklater is able to produce laugh out loud moments whilst providing thought provoking themes such as living in the moment.10/10."
" A snapshot of life, 80's nostalgia and time capsuled movie
",2020-07-07 00:00:00,6,"Set in 1980 in a university in Texas, the film focuses on 72 hours of fun of a group of (mostly dumb) baseball players assemble in a run-down house before classes begin, but all they do is to look for parties and girls. The film's biggest problem is casting. Many of the students look about 35 not as college seniors, while movie characters aren't particularly likable. Another problem is that main protagonist Jake (Blake Jenner) is far more bland than many of the supporting cast (especially Glen Powell). Also, Jake's relationship with an intelligent performing-arts major (awesome Zoey Deutch who is the only significant female character) seems to come out almost of nowhere which feels like it is almost part of a different movie. ""Everybody Wants Some!!"" was not my cup of tea, but it doesn't try to be anything spectacular except a pictorial snapshot of 80's era (Twilight Zone VHS's, Space Invaders, Ping Pong, Van Halen and Carl Sagan). Despite failing to get anywhere, the film itself does capture the feeling and the excitement of having your entire future ahead of you, with literally spelling out its message for us on a blackboard during Jake's first class on Monday. Still, I don't expect to watch it again.Rating: 6 (Rated R)"
" Chill out movie
",2020-06-29 00:00:00,10,I've watched it almost 10 times. Everytime it was time full of calmness and coolness.
" Everybody Wants Some!! (2016)
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,4,"Everybody Wants Some is an obnoxious look at college in the 1980s. Richard Linklater did a great job of capturing the 1970s in Dazed and Confused, but this is not Dazed and Confused. I spent most of the film waiting on the end credits. I will admit that towards the end the movie gets better. I started enjoying the last twenty minutes when those credits I was sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for cake up, and I was wondering why the first half of the film couldn't be like the end. This film seems to appeal to many people but I personally do not like the raunchy humor (of lack of humor) that this film contains."
" Not Linklater's best, but likely better than you might expect
",2020-03-09 00:00:00,7,"Everybody Wants Some is an interesting film. What we have here is about 2 hours of a comedy with barely any story, no real stakes, very little emotion or drama, little in the way of actually likeable characters, and some scenes that aren't even particularly funny. It is funny in parts, of course, but a good deal of this movie is really just 'being' with a host of over the top, sometimes very grating characters as they slack off, party, act like jerks, and have fun. If you're not in the mood for that kind of movie, I could see this being an absolutely infuriating experience. I'll admit, I've seen this twice now, and at points in both those instances, I wanted to slap some sense into some characters because of how frustratingly pretentious, rude, and jerk-ish they sometimes acted. BUT: there were times I didn't feel this way. There were times in which I found myself having a good deal of fun and feeling relaxed because of how laidback and stakes-free the movie is. Sometimes the characters weren't annoying and were actually pretty funny.That's likely the point. Everybody Wants Some humanises its characters and really just presents them for what they are, with little in the way of commentary or critique on their behaviour. I get the sense Linklater is saying: 'hey, here's what we did in our spare time, and during the summer, back in college during the early 80s. Watch it or don't.' It's both admirable and frustrating because of this overall attitude. Admirable because the movie is surprisingly watchable for most of its runtime, but frustrating because it could have been perhaps better if it had done a little more in the way of critiquing or satirising the behaviour of its characters.It's a lazy movie in terms of feel, but the fact that it is sometimes very fun makes me hesitant to call it a lazy movie in terms of its structure and craft. I'm guessing Linklater actually put a tremendous amount of effort into giving it this sort of feel and have it be bearable at the same time. If you can get on its level, and work yourself into the sort of mood it wants you to feel, then Everybody Wants Some is a movie that you can get a great deal of enjoyment out of watching.Still, it is a somewhat perplexing movie to think about. There's little else like it, in terms of being such an unashamedly direct 'hang out' movie and little else. I don't love it but I don't hate it. I think it's solidly made but wish it truly excelled when it came to its direction, writing, or acting (I feel like all were done a little better in Linklater's previous Dazed & Confused. That one just evokes a time and a place much more compellingly too, and the fact that so many of the characters are young and naïve makes them more likeable and less frustrating than the college-age characters here).Or perhaps I'm just overthinking it. Give your brain a rest, hang out with some idiots, and enjoy an admittedly really good soundtrack. Everybody wants some time to relax every now and then, so Everybody Wants Some may be a perfect opportunity to do just that. Linklater has made bolder, better movies, but I can't fault this one for doing exactly what I think it wants to do, and above all else, it's mostly entertaining. Give it a shot, even though I can't see it being for everyone (and like mentioned before: it's certainly not a film made for every mood)."
" So good - but it helps if you were there in the '80s
",2020-02-21 00:00:00,8,"I found this flick to be really funny & a pretty accurate version of dudes at that age in the '80s. Care free no responsibilities, perenially in search of.. I recognised many of the people depicted, it was a scream. And the music was so right. I was simply stunned by it. I lived for a period of time with uni students in accomodation near the uni., except I had a government tech job and a motorcycle. We were all mates before and after they started uni and the lifestyle & attitude was pretty accurate. It brought back a lot of memories particularly brought on by the music too. It was a special time in life which was short lived before knowlege of life and adult responsibilities came to the fore. It's a well made comedy, it's just a 'movie' but the attitude & outlook was captured well. I couldn't believe so many people gave this flick only 1 star - I'm guessing they were all too young to have been able to relate to the content. I was born in '62 and I can reliably report the movie was pretty accurate."
" Slice of life college movie from 1980, but one of Linklater's weaker films
",2020-02-03 00:00:00,7,"While I did enjoy this movie, it's from a different era and recounts experiences from a generation that isn't mine. While I'm also Gen X and middle aged, I was still in Elementary school in 1980, not finishing High School until the end of the decade. My college years are the (early-to-mid) 1990s, not the 1980s. It does indeed ""feel"" like a spiritual successor to Dazed & Confused. It captures the Zeitgeist of an age. As a Texan, I can tell you the college & town depicted are totally fiction. There is no Southeast Texas State...geographically that would be identical with the University of Houston....but you could grab a UH yearbook from 1980 and actually look up the members of the baseball team, which is not Linklater's point. I've attended a number of different Universities in the State of Texas, as have family members....the setting is meant to evoke the generic Texas college experience set in a small college town....places like Texas State University in San Marcos, or Sam Houston State in Huntsville. Not top tier schools like TAMU or UT-Austin, but mid-range schools the average Texas High School student could attend on a sports scholarship in 1980. I was never a college athlete but I did spend my first 3 semesters at TAMU in the Corps of Cadets, essentially a military fraternity that is like college ROTC on steroids. As such the characters were at once relatable on some level but given the decade of difference quite unlike my own life experience, too. I definitely had my favorites among the cast and appreciated how the main character both managed to fit in and find a place on the team but also strike out (ha) and find his own path, willing to be genuine and pursue a real relationship with a smart college girl in preference to a one night stand. I also couldn't help but like the mustachioed blonde team captain...kind of a social butterfly without a fixed identity but flexible and charismatic. The soundtrack is also pretty fantastic. While I have my favorites among Linklater's ouvre and this is not one of them, it's not a bad film. It's an intensely nostalgic film that probably has the strongest appeal to people who are Linklater's age...and Linklater himself is a Boomer not an X'er, and while many of his films speak strongly to Gen X, this one did not, but there's nothing wrong with that--it just is what it is. I don't begrudge the man his memories and appreciate his sharing them."
" Random
",2020-01-29 00:00:00,2,"Totally random and pointless whatever movie. Wannabe cult comedy but completely missed the point. In my opinion there is nothing funny, and certainly not surprising.
Actors look like 30+ and act like teenagers.
Overacting bunch and of happy unrealistic group of men.
Good-looking women serve only as clickbait.
Good retro eighties vibe though..."
" Dazed 2
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,8,Linklater at his best with making a film with just dialog and not much much of a plot but it works really with the spirited sequel to Dazed and Confused
" Everybody Wants Some...story? Of course they would, it just isn't here.
",2019-09-01 00:00:00,2,"There's not too much to say about this film that hasn't already been said. It doesn't have any story. There's no real conflict, no antagonist, no story arc. No problem that needs resolving, no setback that a character needs to overcome. It's just watching a bunch of jocks having a good time set in 1980. That's about it. I was beginning to think there wouldn't even be any baseball, but they do have a few minutes of them practising. The scenes with the lead character (the one who it felt like we was supposed to be the focus of the story) and his 'love interest' feel forced and grind the movie to a halt. Everyone has their funny one-liners, there's lots of 70s references, the little rap video they do at the end credits is also a fun touch, if you liked the characters.
But ultimately, there's nobody you really connect with. The lack of story just meant that you can turn off the movie any time, turn it back on two days later, and you didn't miss anything or forget anything. The indication of the date and the winding down towards first class was a gimmick that seemed unnecessary too.
Walking Dead fans might get a kick out of seeing Dwight here without his scarred face. Otherwise, most of the actors I didn't recognize.
So if you don't mind a movie that has not much to say, and you're just happy to see a bunch of jocks razzing each other for 2 hours non-stop, then this is the movie for you."
" Better than Dazed and Confused
",2019-08-21 00:00:00,8,"So, if this is basically a rehash of themes and nostalgia parlor tricks that works pretty similar to ""Dazed and Confused,"" (D&C) then what is it about this film that I like better than that one?First, the main character. In ""Everybody Wants Some,"" (EWS) Jake is so much more likable and relatable to most people that I imagine would be watching this film. Let's face it, most freshman in high school probably shouldn't be watching D&C and I, for one, found it hard to identify as much with that films protagonist because he was so young and a terrible actor on top of it.In EWS though, Jake is a lot more like I was at that age and he's a far better actor so I connected with him better.Especially if you played sports in high school or college, this movie's focus on the baseball team will really bring you back as they jab at each other, screw each other over, and make friends with the rest of the team. If you didn't play sports, that's ok. EWS is still more relatable than D&C because the characters are older, smarter, and have a lot more freedom to stretch their legs. They are more like adults and as most people will be seeing this either adsThose are reasons why I like the film better but here's why I think most people will like the film better. It's about college. This makes a huge difference since most people seeing this movie will be college age or older when they do. There are other things that come with covering college as a subject that make it a better movie too.The first weekend of college is awesome. Your first experiences as a high school freshman? Probably not so much.High school is an interesting period to cover in a film, for sure, but EWS is fun in a way that D&C never really was for me. College is about freedom and, for the first time, being able to make your own decisions with no one to answer to for them. It's a time for pushing boundaries and that's what the kids in ""Everybody Wants Some,"" do. High school is about surviving and just getting by. That theme just isn't nearly as fun as in EWS."
" Richard Linklater Has Done And Created Another Terrific Coming Of Age Film Mix With Comedy, Humor And a Little Bit Of a Romantic Love Story That Takes in Early 1980s.

" Not awful but very obvious
",2019-06-28 00:00:00,6,"In general, I'n not a fan for the films of Richard Linklater, but I will confess to having enjoyed 'Dazed and Confused', a sympathetic account of the last day in high school of a group of Texas teenagers in the 1970s. Aside from its brilliant title, that film was a non-judemental and unforced look at their lives; and in some ways, Linklater is back onto similar territory with 'Everybody Wants Some!!', which follows a group of first year students as they start college. But this movie did not do it for me. The characters are a group of male baseball scholars, and their stereotypical obsessions about sex, love of partying and general jockishness put me off; it's not just that I didn't like them, but also, their story arcs felt exagerrated given the entire film takes place over their first weekend. Also, for a film which is many ways has a realistic feel, eveveryone is far too good looking on average, and the male actors in particular are far too old."
" Solid 7, enjoyable and relatable, but suffers from 3 main problems...
",2019-06-11 00:00:00,7,"...the first of which is the wrong choice of actor for the lead role. Jenner is not bad in the role, and appears to be a decent actor, however, he is not the right pick for a character that really needed to have the naivety of youth but the charisma to take the audience on his journey of self-discovery. To be honest, he comes across as more of a 'try hard', than the down-to-earth young guy trying to find his way in this new world, which, at least according to me, appeared to be what the film was going for.The second issue is a lack of character development among several of the characters. There are a lot of central characters in this film and it always appears as if the movie is stretched too thin when it comes to really unpacking who the characters are, and what their individual motivations and experiences of college life really are.This could be an issue with the actors that were chosen, but screen time is too limited to gain a solid understanding of all of the characters, the result being that several of them just come off as 'frat boy' cliches.The other issue affecting this film, which was not an issue with 'Dazed and Confused', is the focus on 'bro culture', and the complete lack of ANY female perspective of college life beyond 'frat chicks' and ONE character who defies this stereotype of college life for women (Deutch), who does well to bring a more nuanced character portrayal of 'intelligent university girl' to the movie, but, quite rightly, should not have been expected to fly that flag all on her own, and in the end, it really just becomes what she was put there to be in the first place ""intelligent university girl', among a sea of frat-chicks...(will women ever be allowed to move beyond the dichotomy of the virgin and the w***e?).Add to this the general lack of chemistry between Deutch and Jenner, and it makes for two characters we don't care too much about, in a relationship we don't care too much about.The two gems of the film are McReynalds (Hoechlin), and Finnegan (Powell), who use their limited screen time to make the most of their characters, and as such, have great audience appeal.Hoechlin portrays McReynalds perfectly, as the quintessential, ""all American"" boy. He effortlessly encapsulates the dichotomy between being part of 'jock culture' but having the weight of the team; the university; his community; his parents and his future on his shoulders; constantly striving for perfection so that nobody is disappointed, and who has the mental toughness, determination and focus to 'make it'.The antithesis of McReynalds is Powell's interpretation of Finnegan, the guy who was born with looks, natural talent and charisma but who is only in it for the good time, and isn't particularly concerned about the 'serious side' of 'playing ball'. He effortlessly moves between different social circles with his loose philosophical musings, and never allows anything to get too serious. He is, for-all-intents-and-purposes, the heart of the film. And the charisma he brings to the role is truly infectious as an audience member.All-in-all though this is a film worth giving your time to, as it does encapsulate the excitement and wonder of moving out of adolescence and into adulthood with all of it's 'awakenings', which, man or woman, if you allow yourself to take from the movie, can relate to and enjoy.I highly recommend a second viewing once you have seen and understood more what the characters are about. I definitely enjoyed it more second time around."
" Kinetic blast
",2019-05-14 00:00:00,9,"Richard Linklater's spiritual sequel to Dazed and Confused is kinetic, funny, relatable, beautiful, and poetic in all the ways that his best films can be. Where some of his films meander, this film is focused. I love it."
" It's all a bit of a bro'verdose.
",2019-04-21 00:00:00,5,"The music is authentic, but to steal an SAT analogy, the characters are to real students as the chorus line in South Pacific was to real sailors: caricatures created to tell us things we already know about the virtues and deficits of callow youth."
" A Magnificent Period Film That's Worth More Than It Seems
",2019-04-14 00:00:00,8,"EVERYBODY WANTS SOME!! is Linklater's successor to his 1993 masterpiece DAZED & CONFUSED, if only in spirit. Previously, DAZED's reputation traveled largely on the basis of perceived nostalgia, but EWS!!'s entry into this (now) diptych transforms DAZED's role as a part of a larger-scale, entirely neglected utility of the period film: anthropology.Much has been made of of EWS!!'s eschewing of a conventional plotline as a detriment, but I argue that the meandering and static events of the film are the very point, and that a plot would actually do a disservice to that purpose. EWS!! is a forensic recreation of a 3-day period in 1980, when Linklater himself would have been playing college baseball. Linklater's own singular eidetic memory serves to restore what most period films lack: the detailed minutiae of interpersonal communication. Period films historically have been able to recapture clothing, props, hairstyles, and other fashions of a given period, but more difficult (and perhaps most difficult) is to recreate the mannerisms and speech patterns of said time and place, and Linklater does this masterfully. For myself, watching the film reminded me of things I haven't seen in social situations since I was a child but were as clear as a bell upon seeing it rendered with almost documentary authenticity. Every character (with one exception) fits the era almost perfectly, with characters such as McReynolds and Beuter seemingly brought directly out of 1980 to the future for this film.EWS!! intends to immerse the viewer into the very time period itself as if they were a native to it. To facilitate this, Linklater avoids all stylistic photography, shooting everything with neutral or natural lighting to replicate how the people of the time would see it, and not how later generations would do so by using vintage aesthetics to imply the past seen retroactively as we might through aged photos or obsolete media (THE GODFATHER, SCHINDLER'S LIST, etc.).EWS!! is as close as I feel to making a period film without using time-travel to get there, and the focus on the sheer mundanity of the narrative solidifies this. The film is a look back in time, not to any great historical events, but into the parts of history that get left behind: the details of an everyday life.It gets my vote as one of the best films of 2016 and one of the best films in Linklater's oeuvre."
" 2 hours i will never get back
",2019-04-02 00:00:00,5,"I cannot see how this movie has such high scores. There is no story. It is just a bunch of teens in the 80s being... teens/jocks. I found it boring as hell. No depth to any of the characters, screenplay, story, nothing."
" Is this really a movie?
",2019-01-27 00:00:00,1,No it is just a boring series of non humor jokes.. I couldn't laugh.. I watched it based on high rate but I was mislead..
" Disappointing
",2018-07-28 00:00:00,6,"EVERYBODY WANTS SOME feels much less a companion piece to BOYHOOD (as Richard Linklater has stated) than a reshaping of the iconic DAZED AND CONFUSED. Shots, events and character types of both movies show us the antics of unsupervised young adults run wild, although now the setting is college - not high school (I would liken it to the Goodfellas/Casino relationship). As a result, it's impossible to watch or rate Everybody Wants Some without comparing to its 1993 predecessor. The different characters from Everybody Wants Some (and the actors they play them), however, aren't as vibrant as the ones from Dazed And Confused, making it a far from a masterpiece. Not to mention, Linklater (who is known for his impeccable authenticity in casting) cast the oldest-looking group of 25/30 year old actors you could find, making it hard to buy them as college kids. Furthermore, the lead - a confident baseball player arriving for his first year on campus - played by Blake Jenner - falls disappointingly short of the typical Linklater hero. The whole script, which follows Jenner and an overabundant number of his college baseball teammates, does have a few moments to grab laughs but it keeps being dragged down by its lack of personalities. That being said, Linklater has the remarkable ability to find the truth in young adult life and verbalize it unlike most fictional storytellers and he delivers here. Unfortunately, in contrast to his high calibre of work, he's fallen a little off the base with this one. Ted's Grade: A disappointing B minus for an A student."
" Almost 2hr....And they just flow By
",2018-07-02 00:00:00,9,"Another of those gems by Linklater. Movie has a very good feel about it and if you along with it and feel the old vibes,you will love it."
" Simple yet so satisfying
",2018-06-28 00:00:00,9,"I freaking love this movie!! 
It's simple and satisfying, just perfect. Lots of good laughs. A feel good college baseball experience."
" No plot at all
",2018-06-18 00:00:00,2,"In 1980, a group of college baseball players navigate their way through the freedoms and responsibilities of unsupervised adulthood. 
THE END
That´s it, there is no story, no plot at all. I watched this movie, because I saw Blake Jenner in ""Billy Boy"", where he did a good job, although the movie itself is rather mediocre. 
This one , however, was a complete waste of time, unless you like to watch a bunch of frat boys getting wasted, smoking weed and doing all kind of stupid things, avoid this at any cost."
" Crap
",2018-06-17 00:00:00,1,My wife laughs when I enjoy cheap B movies. I deleted it after the first 5 minutes. That says a lot!
" Great sit down and watch movie
",2018-05-27 00:00:00,8,I don't understand the bad reviews. I was half way through this movie before I pressed pause so I could go online and order it. Just a great movie that is fun to watch and doesn't rely on CGI to entertain. I'm not big on college baseball but this movie was fun.
" aw crap
",2018-04-07 00:00:00,2,Being an 80s person was looking for some good nostalgia feels or fun dazed and confused feels or maybe even some baseball. unfortunately it fell quite short in all those categories. i think that's the issue; tried to be all of those but didn't quite get close to anything. pretty disappointing and that sucks had good potential in the first 20 mins but didn't go anywhere. unless you played baseball in college i would skip.
" Linklater disappointed me
",2018-03-24 00:00:00,4,"I really love Richard Linklater´s work....Boyhood, The Before Trilogy, Waking life, A scanner darkly.I was actually expecting that this movie was as profound and as interesting than his other movies. But, instead of that, I spent two hours watching a film that goes nowhere. The history and its caracthers are quite dumb. They´re just stereotypes. I really don´t understand which was the motivation to film this. It´s just another dumb and empty movie about college students."
" Waiting for the next!
",2018-02-16 00:00:00,9,"Haven't seen dazed and confused, but this movie is awesome. waiting for the next."

" Fun trip down memory lane
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"Another really enjoyable Linklater film - very different to 'Boyhood' and almost a sequel to the high school-set 'Dazed and Confused' - 'Everybody Wants Some!!' is the story of college, as seen through the eyes of baseball pitcher Jake (Jenner). He has it pretty good - an off-campus dorm (not quite a fraternity) at an unnamed Texas university, where he and his teammates pretty much have free reign. The film's set in 1980 and looks the piece - great cars, crap hair, dodgy fashion, mo's everywhere. Plus, the music!The soundtrack is exceptional, and I imagine if you were of the right age in 1980, it would take you straight back there - The Knack, Cheap Trick, ZZ Top, Parliament, Blondie, Queen, Pink Floyd, Devo and, of course, Van Halen, with the eponymous song. There's plenty of fun and plenty of characters, with the teammates going to three different parties in three nights before classes commence - but the film's not all about drugs, sex and alcohol - although they're quite prevalent. It's really about finding out who you are or want to be as a young adult and along with the quips, jokes and games, there's a few nice philosophical moments thrown in - plenty courtesy of Finnegan (Powell) and Dale (Johnson).Beverly (Deutch) is a nice love interest and it's great to see most of the dozen characters get a decent airing. A few oddballs for the laughs, but plenty of realistic college-age pastimes too. There's no real focus on baseball other than for about 15min, which is good. It's a good cross between 'Bad Neighbours' and 'Animal House', with not as much outrageousness, but a fair bit of heart. The film's probably 20min too long, but it's still enjoyable with a good ending."
" Fun, lighthearted, nostalgic look at the 80's college experience
",2017-12-26 00:00:00,8,"This movie was refreshingly light, fun and intelligent. Even the tension in the movie felt fun and easy. Not all movies have to have blood and cursing to be interesting. It reminded me of the innocence and fun we had in the early 80's the easiness of everything despite our reckless behavior. The music, the outfits, Disco and the attitude all contributed to what the early 80's was about. This movie didn't try to overdo things and it made me smile. I loved the characters and the pranks. I'm so tired of movies that feel they must constantly have to insert unnecessary violence and language... it's stressful... can't we just have a movie that just reminds us how fun it was to be young and without the worries and stresses of being in the adult world. Winner for me!"
" Boring and unfunny. Basically nothing of substance happened during the entire movie.
",2017-12-22 00:00:00,4,"OK my title is a tad bit harsh but it is basically how I feel about this after watching it, it was certainly not all boring and I think as a whole is more watchable than some other movies but for a 'comedy' was not what was expected, there was not even a moment of laughter during the whole movie let alone a small chuckle, I feel this could just as easily be call a drama instead of comedy and it could have easily ended after twenty minutes or gone on another 2 hours and either way I feel the audience would end up knowing the characters just as well and had just as good a story told. The acting was great and I found the individual characters likable (the tiny amount that I knew them) but I found the story to be very thin without any substance and character development to be non existent culminating by going nowhere and simply ending on a flat note."
" A Bromance to Nowhere
",2017-11-26 00:00:00,4,"I'm the perfect recipient for this film. I ""should"" be giving it a ""10"". I went to college in 1979. I love the soundtrack. I got laid my first weekend at college. I joined a frat & lived with 45 guys. True, the 45 guys were a heckuva lot smarter & somewhat less athletic than these guys. I was never a pothead, but I sat through pothead-philosophy sessions. I had friends who sat there & did things like the knuckle-banging contest. I went through the whole team-bonding thing of a sports team. All of it. The problem is ... there is nothing here. There has to be something more than just nostalgia.Maybe the problem is that I didn't go to college in TX, at a state U. I don't know. I do know that I'd rate it lower than a ""4"", but to do that seems like dissing myself.ps: I love how IMDb thinks the right way to spell ""heckuva"" is ""helluva"". lmao @ the people who program these sites"
" Quite Entertaining
",2017-09-25 00:00:00,8,"For all of you expecting a dazed and confused 2 think again. This movie has a totally different vibe and feel to it but that doesn't mean it was bad. I really enjoyed this movie because it depicted 1980s pretty accurately and for people complaining the movie had no plot neither did dazed or confused (which I also liked a lot). Maybe i'm just biased because I love the 1980s but the movie was entertaining and had me laughing and while some of the acting was a little off it's forgivable. Basically a summary is these guys are ""hot stuff"" and are just trying to find out where are the ladies are at. I would recommend if you are looking for a goofy laid back movie that doesn't take any thinking at all"
" Not *everybody*
",2017-09-05 00:00:00,2,"I'm pretty sure I wasn't the target audience for this, as I am one of the few people who ""Dazed and Confused"" failed to charm when I first saw it... Alright! Alright? Alright.I suppose the 70's setting of its spiritual forerunner was mildly interesting, but 20+ years later, when the focus shifts to the 80's, one would have hoped that its worldview - self absorbed stoners searching for chicks - would be seen as passe...The central relationship is fairly cute, but it doesn't get much attention, because the film seems besotted by the yahoos that surround them, instead....I would pass, on whatever it is that this is selling. It's a serious case of arrested development, and you've got to grow up, sometime!"
" Seems incomplete
",2017-08-15 00:00:00,6,"Whilst watching the film, it seemed to have promise. Most of the actors did a good job; there were some well written parts and some parts that were pretty funny and entertaining. Before watching the film I read a review on here that described the film as it 'bounced around so much from topic to topic without actually getting into any of them'. I would say this is a very accurate description as I felt that nothing was really developed fully. Instead when the credits rolled I couldn't believe it was over already as nothing substantial had even happened. I felt like the beginning of the plot after we had met the characters and were waiting to see what would happen next, but that was really it, the film felt over before it even had begun!I'd have to say that Zoey Deutch did a great job despite the unfortunate and underwhelming plot.Overall, what's there of the film really isn't bad, it just feels incomplete to me with nothing really happening and no end goal or message being conveyed, which left me utterly underwhelmed."
" Waste of time.
",2017-08-12 00:00:00,4,"Everybody wants some If you're going to do product placement in a 70's movie, you should use props that look like they're from the 70s or 80s or whenever this lame hipster movie is posing as. I wasn't even alive back then but even I can tell you Dr. Pepper soda pop cans looked different, with a bigger top; not like the current can with a smaller head and bigger body. I wouldn't have even noticed if the product placement was so obvious and had as much screen time as it did. For a time span of at least 5 minutes it seemed like half the cast and extras walking around in the streets were drinking nothing but Dr. Pepper out of cans from 30 years into the future. Anyway, the film has a high production value but no real story. It is just a series of ultra- clean and artificial scenes of what someone who as never watched a film made in the seventies thinks the seventies looked like. You can tell a lot of money was put into this film, too bad they didn't chuck-in a few dollars more and buy a decent script."
" Too Repetitive
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,6,"""Everybody Wants Some"", written and directed by Richard Linklater, is certainly a tribute to 80s comedy and era culture. It starts out promisingly for the introductory 15 min or so setting up the place, time, and characters - 1980 Southeastern Texas College which may be fictional (I've never heard of it) pretty well. The look, costuming, and locales are done well. The problem though is this movie runs almost 2 hrs and spends over an hour of it portraying a cycling a frat-lifestyle partying over 3 or 4 days which comes off as one overlong scene. If you can manage though the semi-monotony into the last 30 min, the movie finally picks up on some good character development and love interest. This love-interest should've been put in the first quarter or third of the run-time and more the focus. I liked the movie for its homage, and although it did have several funny parts its strength might've been served in more drama rather than repetitive antics. 6/10 - mixed."
" Nostalgic
",2017-07-01 00:00:00,8,"Overall great film, great representation of the early 80's. Explores themes of friendship, brotherhood, and just being young and having fun. Great performances all-around. Richard Linklater has knack for making films with heart and nostalgia and he succeeds in doing so with this film. The soundtrack is amazing which coincides with the story very well."
" Stoner Movie and Life lessons
",2017-05-03 00:00:00,9,"Reading some of these reviews really disappoint me. I thought this was a great film, especially good as a stoner film. First, I want to address the complaint that Jack and his teammates are seemingly flawless jocks who have no problem pulling in the ladies. The students start plenty of awkward conversations and they usually get rejected but they do not let it discourage them. It is their ability to try again that makes them seem so unbelievably socially talented. It just goes to show that failure goes unnoticed once you get good. They are all competitive baseball players who don't like losing, let alone get discouraged by rejections from girls or bullying from their seniors.Everybody Wants Some takes place in the 1980s and three days prior to the first day of college classes. The story follows Jake whose one of the four freshmen to receive a scholarship for baseball at Southeast Texas Cherokees College. The film begins with Jake moving into the baseball team's frat house which he shares with the other freshmen and seniors, all of whom are hotshot baseball players. Although Jake and the other freshmen are serious for baseball, they understand that not everybody's going to make it to the professional level. And they're okay with that because they are there for more than just baseball. The film explores the identity crisis of the freshmen as they try to fit into the college lifestyle and get laid. Their team mentality gets them far as they lookout for each other and learn from their seniors but it's not all without fail as we watch them deal with their difficult teammates and getting rejected by numerous girls. Many reviews say thatthe film doesn't have a plot but in my opinion, it doesn't need one. The film is about having fun and finding yourself. It is full of life lessons like when Willoughby, the philosophical stoner of the group said, "" You've got to embrace your inner strange, man. Just be weird."" This is reflected by the team's openness to trying new things such as smoking pot or going to a disco and punk rock dance on the same day."
" Ass end of a skunk
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,1,"As a huge fan of Dazed and Confused, yes, I actually saw it first in a movie theater, this movie stunk so bad I can't believe it actually got released at all. Even the out-take rap video at the end sucked so bad. Some of the lines were good and the music was spot on, but who wrote this movie really? Were they professional writers or high school kids? I kept going back and looking for something positive to say and I honestly can't think of a thing. Oh, the 442 was cool. If this is all you got left in your Rich, time to hang up your spurs. Really..."
" Okay, but not great, effort from Richard Linklater
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,6,"1980. Jake is about to start his college education. He has a baseball scholarship and lives in a commune that consists of the entire college baseball team. College starts in three days and we see how he adapts and makes new friends.Written and directed by Richard Linklater who gave us Boyhood and the Before Sunset/Sunrise/Midnight series this is ostensibly the college version of what is, for me, his greatest film - Dazed and Confused. (Calling a sequel would be pushing it a bit far as there is no link between the characters). There are some similarities between the two - the dawning of the new phase in young people's lives, new experiences and fitting in - but quality- and feeling-wise the two are quite far apart. Dazed and Confused was wonderfully engaging, and immediately so, and had a great sense of nostalgia. It was also quite profound in the way it dealt with growing up.Everybody Wants Some!!, on the other hand, starts off rather dully, with Linklater trying too hard to make the characters cool and likable, and in the process making them irritating, and the plot doesn't really go anywhere for a while. The engagement isn't there to start off with and it all seems like Animal House or Porky's without the humour.It gets better though, with the characters gaining some depth (thus becoming more engaging), some interesting plot developments towards the end and a reasonably profound ending. It just takes patience to get there - I was ready to give up after less than 30 minutes."
" A Trip to the 80s
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,5,"If you went to college in the 1980s, then this movie will take you back there. The clothes, hair, music, and ambiance are perfect. If you were a guy, you can doubly relate. And if you played baseball or are a fan, then you will really relate to these highly competitive, wholly immature crew where every guy was the best player on his high school team, but now are just barely good enough to be here.That being said, this movie really goes nowhere. There's no real plot, just counting down the hours in those last days before classes start. A bunch about male bonding, camaraderie, competition, and paths in life. It's not particularly humorous, even with all the drinking, pot smoking, and focus on the players getting laid laying the groundwork for an ""Animal House"" - like romp. (Nudity is very minimal, to the extent it seems inserted just so they could say there was nudity. bummer.) It doesn't seem like Southeast Texas State has many/any unattractive students though.The chemistry between the two leads is limited, and not just due to their limited time together. Sorry, I'm not buying that elaborate OZ party by the theater geeks before school has even started. Two ""good"" people with really nothing in common, but they have sex without even a realdate? The film ends at a beginning, letting you run with it.If you want to go back in time, great film. But not much other reason to watch."
" Can I get my money back?
",2017-04-15 00:00:00,3,"If you thought Dazed and Confused was great, you'll love this movie. Here's how Everybody Wants Some!! compares to that movie:1) There is no point/plot 2) It's completely sexist and anti-feminist3) All the jokes are about sex and not funny 4) The story line looks like it was written in about 5 minutes"
" This movie SUCKS!!!!!!
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,1,"I tried watching this movie twice and it is not funny, too long and very disappointing considering the Dazed and Confused director made this. I get the 1980's theme, I AM GEN X, but that is the only good thing about this movie.A good comedy is 90-100 min. Making this go two hours is a waste of time, the nudity was good but that is it..........."
" ""Dazed and Confused"", it is not.
",2017-04-05 00:00:00,4,"Although I wasn't foolish enough to think this would be on the level of ""Dazed"", which has of course, gone on to achieve ""cult classic"" status, I at least expected to be entertained. Sadly, I was not. I guess you could say that this movie was just like ""Dazed"", minus the acting, writing, good characters, memorable quotes, and enjoyability factor. The only positive things the two movies had in common were that they both took place over a relatively short period of time during a transitional period in an adolescent's life, and that they both had a good soundtrack. Other than that, ""Everybody"" captured none of the magic of its predecessor. I realize that Linklater intentionally cast unknowns in this movie, and a couple of them held their own. However, there were two others who were woefully inadequate for a major motion picture. I won't mention their names because I don't want to disparage anyone who was basically just plucked from obscurity to star in a film. But their acting performances were a distraction to the story. Their roles desperately needed some better direction or re-casting altogether. Overall, I was disappointed."
" Another fun, cool, nostalgia-driven think-piece from Linklater, and that's it
",2017-03-24 00:00:00,7,"Word around town has been that Richard Linklater's ""Everybody Wants Some!!"" is a ""spiritual sequel"" to 1993's ""Dazed & Confused,"" his seminal work of nostalgia set on the last day of high school in May 1976. It makes sense: ""Everybody Wants Some!!"" is set during the few days before classes at a Texas university in August 1980. The setup is an obvious tie-in, but the ""spiritual"" similarities don't end there. Both draw energy from their soundtracks and both are a low- intensity, fun watches despite their lack of narrative direction.The film follows the school's baseball team who basically live in a fraternity house together. Jake Bradford (Blake Jenner) is a freshman who moves in and must immediately hold his own in group of big personalities intent on messing with him. In fact, a majority of the film is built on this low-grade hazing that the group refers to as ""****withery,"" or the concept of cleverly dishing verbal wit or pranks (and being able to take them). In between the hijinks is Linklater's distinct brand of off-the-cuff philosophizing in the form of characters hanging out. Oh, and a little bit of sex and romance for good measure.The cast includes mostly under-the-radar talents, and it will be interesting to see – liked ""Dazed & Confused"" – which of them go on to be recognizable faces that will make watching this film 10 years from now even more interesting (e.g. Matthew McConaughey and Ben Affleck in ""Dazed""). Glen Powell's Finnegan is sort of the guru of the team – a wizard with the ladies and of wit, and clearly someone capable of doing much greater things. His performance is the most enjoyable, especially compared to a Juston Street as Jay ""Raw Dog"" Miles, the ace pitching prospect with serious mental-emotional issues. But no matter, all of these characters are in an incredible point in their lives, where trial and error is how you figure out who you are.""Dazed & Confused"" was the nostalgic love letter to those waning high school days, and this is Linklater's love letter to college life. The difference between the two is that one is an ending and the other a beginning. This film bleeds optimistic anticipation. What's more exciting than being on the precipice of your college experience? Not everything is rosy, of course, when you make this big transition as Jake does, but Linklater idealizes every second of it. There's no drama in this movie except tension between characters, and more significantly, there are no consequences. The point, perhaps, is that even if you make mistakes, by and large you remember college as if it was perfect.And lastly, ""Everybody Wants Some!!"" shares some of the same challenges as ""Dazed & Confused."" Challenges – not flaws – because they're the product of Linklater's conscious choice; a story without any plot places a lot of pressure on character and dialogue to hold our interest, and quality scene-writing capable of tapping into our emotions. Most filmmakers trying to do what Linklater does in both these films would serve up something that feels truly pointless. Linklater, however, has always had a profound perspective and a view of life and the world that resonates with people. That carries ""Everybody Wants Some!!"" pretty far, but only so far if you're the typical moviegoer. It's the type of movie that's easy to watch and unmistakably cool, but there's a ceiling  a pretty cool ceiling. ~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Review for more"
" recalls details and conversations we all had but most of us have forgotten
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,8,"Richard Linklater's films are always a pleasure to watch because his dialogue is so true to life and his characters are so natural and easy to relate too. Coming of the labor of love that was Boyhood, Linklater now focuses on the college life of a freshman joining the baseball team much like his movie Dazed and Confused in the 90's focused on high school. Just like actual college, it is a bit of a mess and more fractured and random than you would hope it would be. In high school there were rules you could rebel against, but once you are on your own and considered a ""grown up"", the lack of rules or a clear path can be alienating and scary. It all adds up to an entertaining semester in a young man's life that recalls details and conversations we all had but most of us have forgotten. How is Linklater so good and presenting what needs to be focused on and said every single time he makes a movie?"
" very bad movie
",2017-03-08 00:00:00,1,it's like wasting your time for nothing i don't believe it took 7 out of 10 in rating. I am sorry but i used to check IMDb website before seeing any movie but now i won't do it no more because it disappointed me thanks for taken 2 hours from my life ..
" ramblin' times
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,7,"It's 1980, days before college classes start. Jake Bradford (Blake Jenner) is a freshman pitcher. The baseball team has two houses off-campus. They are the only sports team at school who wins. It's a life of parties and girls. Jake is taken with performing major Beverly (Zoey Deutch).From Richard Linklater, this has a lot in common with Dazed and Confused (1993). It's not quite as good. The end point of this movie is never going to be as compelling as the one in Dazed. Blake Jenner is not that charismatic although he's plenty of hot-blooded all-American. His best early scene is Beuter refusing to give him the room. It's knowing that Beuter is written as a douche but it's Jake who comes off as entitled. He doesn't come off that well and needs Beverly to make his character more complete. There are a few good performances from the other guys. There are some great characters. The plot rambles around until it doesn't."
" A Waste of time. No story or Characters to care or pay attention to.
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,3,"First of all this movie is not good. there are a quite a few things that this movies does wrong but the biggest one is that it has no purpose. it does not know where it wants to end. it is just a somewhat funny event after another. when the trailer came out and I saw the setting and I read that Linklater was directing I thought to myself maybe this is in the realm of animal house. A good story set in a university with students. this is not the case. There is no actual plot. In animal house there is a plot. There is something that the characters try to achieve and in the process they get to all sorts of trouble. This movie literally lost me in the first 25 minutes since there was no plot, no story, no endgame. As for the characters they are not good. Everyone has more or less a quirky attribute. Jake and Finn are the least uninteresting characters but still that is not enough. Also it is constantly mentioned that all the characters are in the baseball team, yet the movie is not about them winning the title it is just constantly mentioned. One of the pitchers and the strikers which are kind of have a short fuse and are competitive have a scene together that escalates and instead of actually letting the argument escalate they just say we cool and the tension disappears when we were hoping for something to actually happen.Now the end. The final scene is Jake in class on the first day of school about to sleep on his desk and then the movie ends. After two hours and endless ""funny"" moments and weird situations the movie just ends. I wasted 2 hours without any kind of reward. This movie lost me from the beginning because of it's lack of a central plot or story and that was confirmed in the end where the movie just ended. when the movie ended I thought to my self it was just the everyday life of some students/ baseball players. I want to compare it to ""Paterson"" staring Adam Driver. Driver is a bus driver (ha ha) and the film shows the daily life of that character. But the difference is that Paterson was an intriguing and well though out character and that story had an end game. It did not try to make every event this epic and ""cool"" adventure because the life of a bus driver is not constantly epic and cool(no offense). It knew it was about the daily activities and little moments and that's where it focused. Coming back to the actual movie do yourself a favor and don't pay to see this. The only reason that i sat through the whole thing is that I was hoping that there might be some kind of unexpected turn in the story worth waiting for but NO. You Know why? Because there was no STORY!!!!"
" There is no plot.
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,2,"Not much to say really. The movie has no plot. It describes the daily routine of a few college baseball players in the 80's. The acting is not bad and the 80's scenery is well presented but that's it, those are the only reasons to rate with two stars instead of one. I cannot explain the 7.0 rating by thinking reasonably. The only thing that comes to mind is that people who were in their youth in that period got nostalgic. Even films like ""American pie"", even though the main concern is the funny parts, have a story-line and give you some closure. I wonder how this scenario got the sponsorship and people willing to act in it and work for it. In general I would say it's a complete waste of time."
" Wanting and getting
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,8,"Sometimes it's not a question of what you want, but what you can get and if you are able to combine multiple things. In this case it's a couple of days before ""real"" life begins for a bunch of young adults. The movie does not pull any punches, but it won't give you too many life insights or philosophical pandering.But if you weren't looking for something in that regard, you will be entertained by a movie that is just showing how boys will be boys. Especially if they are able to roam free. Yes there are rules, but there is no one to really enforce those. So being responsible is something they have to be on their own. Is that possible? What about group dynamic and pranks and shenanigans? You'll see a couple of them. And we at least get one strong female in this, which may not be that much, considering the male talent on board, but better than nothing"
" Frontiers are where you find them
",2017-01-31 00:00:00,9,"So much more subtle and humane than it appears superficially. Though that should be no surprise considering it's Richard freaking Linklater. And my God is it funny. ""Did he just flick a lime in my drink?!""I noticed a similarity with the structure of La La Land here. This film starts as basically an 80's style college sex romp and transforms into the beginnings of a college set bildungsroman, with a sexless intellectually driven romance at its center. It's about finding your place in a place where everyone is doing that exact same thing (what happens when the best baseball player from every high school in the state goes to the same college?) The evolution of expectations into a more cogent and adult understanding of your place in the world and the beauty inherent in that.This is a cheekier film than Dazed and Confused but in the same way that film was about nostalgia and the best years of your life before it could be understood, this is about the slow dawning of that realization. For some (Wyatt Russell's Willoughby or McConaughey's Wooderson) they realize this all too well and refuse to let go. Linklater finds the humanity in every single person. This is a movie about baseball jocks that couldn't be less about ""jocks"" in that unsubtle sense."
" Linklater can do no wrong
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,9,"Just saw this movie for the 2nd time and I loved it even more than the first time. Just like every Linklater picture, it is so rewatchable. I enjoyed so much being in this world with these characters. Every single one of them is fully drawn out. Linklater is a magician, someone that has mastered his craft to the fullest extent. The cast is great. Glen Powell was the stand out for me, he was excellent. Not far behind him was Wyatt Russell who is establishing himself as an exciting up and coming talent. This was my favorite sports movie since Warrior. I loved everything about it."
" Lot's of fun, great soundtrack
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,9,"The movie opens with freshman college student Jake (Blake Jenner) in his car, on his way to his dorm while 'My Sharona' plays on the background. Watching this movie in December, Summer has never felt closer. Linklater sets the tone of the movie perfectly with this first scene: a hot Southern Summer, set in the early 80's, right at the start of something new. You can feel these three elements in the air through the entire movie, and that's exactly what makes it amazing.The movie follows a baseball team during the first weekend of the academic year, right before classes start. But this isn't just another college movie, we're talking about Linklater here. This however doesn't mean the movie is no fun, because it is. It has all the fun, all the crazy and random drunk moments, jocks, drunk girls and machismo as you can expect from any college movie, but with the difference that every character feels real and has more depth than any Blue Mountain State or American Pie character you'll ever see on the big screen. Richard Linklater knows exactly what college students are like. They're heading towards this quarter life crisis, not knowing which direction they're going, so they decide to lose themselves in the moment. A recurring theme in the movie is competitiveness, they're all athletes, proud to be part of the baseball team and all they want is winning. Finnegan (Glen Powell), arguably the best part of this movie, notices this competition within the group: 'You get a bunch of competitors together, and you're addicted to winning.' Finnegan didn't even have to say this line for us to know it, this remarkable addiction to winning is omnipresent in the entire movie. As I mentioned, the movie plays out over the first weekend of the academic year. and so what you see are simply events, which are entertaining and build character, but however lack story. Although this lack of story didn't bother me, it does make me wonder if the movie would have been better with more depth in terms of story. 'Everybody Wants Some!!' is said to be the spiritual sequel to 'Dazed and Confused', another great Linklater picture. I prefer not to compare both movies, but if you enjoyed Dazed and Confused, you'll enjoy this one. The tone is perfect, the characters feel so real, the soundtrack is perfect, you can feel the summer and hormones in the air, and therefore the movie as a whole is lots of fun."
