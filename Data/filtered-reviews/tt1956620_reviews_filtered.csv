" Sex Tape on 4k ultra hd
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,7,"A married couple wake up to discover that the sex tape they made the evening before has gone missing, leading to a frantic search for its whereabouts now on upgrade Upscaled 4K coming soon on Sony pictures 4k ultra hd release may 2021"
" Can't believe she was in this movie
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,1,I literally cannot believe she agreed to act in this movie. Lowest quality movie she probably agreed to act in. Don't waste your time or money to watch this movie.
" Not really there
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,4,"Long introduction. Dragging and forced plot. Deserves 5 cause you can just quit watching without missing anything. It has some good laughs , though."
" Lots of negative reviews, but I liked it.
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,9,"I thought this was a fun movie. People seem to be taking it way too seriously and bashing it. Jason and Cameron if your reading this, I liked it. Keep it up."
" It started off well, but went downhill fast
",2020-09-07 00:00:00,4,"The premise of this film is actually a good one. It's just a real shame that the poor writing and sometimes unfunny execution let the film down so much. Cameron Diaz suited the role, but Jason Segel I think did not. Honestly I think if you switched Jason Segel and Jack Black in their respective roles, you would have had a funnier movie!
The film starts off really well. With a quite funny 10 minute intro that many can relate to, it was a great setup to the rest of the film. Unfortunately though, what followed was an evenly paced unfunny movie.
The bits that were supposed to be funny just weren't. I think the writers found the script funnier than it was when writing. The execution is what lets it down. There are some scenes that go on for far too long which were not very funny in the first place, which really drags the film on needlessly.
The fact that Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz both acted together in Bad Teacher, another poor film, I think explains a lot about how (not so) good this movie is"
" Stupid and not funny
",2020-08-19 00:00:00,2,"What can you say about a bad comedy other than it's not funny? Sex Tape is a movie entirely built on the premise of a couple that has decided to spice up their love life by recording themselves having sex, and then accidentally releasing that recording to others. For starters, the mental gymnastics they go through in order to explain how the video is spread is utterly moronic. It's clear the writers were trying to figure out a plot device that would allow the ""sex tape"" to be released wide enough to make the couple nervous but not so wide that they can do nothing to contain it. So their solution is to invent a main character who is rich enough to hand out iPads like they are candy, and yet dumb enough to think syncing up his media library to all these devices makes sense. From the beginning this makes Jason Segal both annoying and dumb which is not a good combination in a protagonist.I suppose the stupid premise could be saved if the madcap journey to recover all the iPads had been funny. Poor logic is forgivable in a good comedy, but Sex Tape is about as far from a good comedy as you can get. Their ""wacky"" journey amounts to only 3 stops, and the best attempt at a joke they can muster is having a guy who presents himself as warm and kind, listening to heavy metal and snorting cocaine (while Jason Segel fights with a dog.) This isn't even good enough to make me crack a smile. Most of the twists and turns in the film are predictable, and that also spoils any attempt at surprising you into a laugh. It's sad because I actually like both Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz, and they seem like a good pair to star in a film as a comedic duo. But with a script as uninspiring as what they were given in Sex Tape, no one will ever be clamoring for them to try again."
" So lifeless
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,4,"Such an empty film.This is simply terrible. I didn't laugh at all, which is saying something coming from a guy who enjoys films like 'Kangaroo Jack', 'Thunderpants' and 'Little Man'. 'Sex Tape' is just so lifeless, no good performances across the board.Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel are notable actors, both can be a bit hit-and-miss but are generally quite solid. This is certainly a low point for those two, as well as for the others involved. The only plus is the cameo from Jack Black, which is mildly amusing.Safe to say, I would not recommend this. You could probably make a somewhat good production about a sex tape, but I don't get the impression that this lot put much thought into it at all."
" Pretty funny
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,7,I wasn't expecting much - but this was a pretty funny ass movie. I liked it and would highly recommend
" Somebody please remote-wipe this film from existence
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,2,"It's a shame that this film was so poorly executed as the premise was quite interesting. With a better cast and script, this could have actually been a decent comedy.Cameron Diaz, who was a reasonably equipped actor in the nineties, is now little more than a middle-aged woman trying desperately to retain her valley girl demeanour. And Jason Segel is not going to get his long-awaited Frat Pack induction with performances like this. The poor man's Vince Vaughn is as painful and one-dimensional as ever.The movie trundles along with the usual crass humour and sex talk, occasionally punctuated with banal conversations about love and marriage. When you have a cast as weak as this, it's probably best to just stick to pure slapstick. Nobody needs to hear these vacuous characters pontificating about what makes a strong relationship.The lowlight of the film is the pathetic cameo from Jack Black, who should probably break into Columbia Pictures studios and try to erase this movie from existence.Rob Lowe is probably the only person to come out of this fiasco with any credit. He gives a moderately amusing performance as the eccentric Hank Rosenbaum but most of his scenes are overshadowed by Diaz's highly forced attempts to portray the effects of cocaine.A tragic effort all round, give this one a wide berth."
" mediocre
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,5,"It wasn't particularly funny, I smiled only a few times, it was rather silly.
I will not watch this film a second time, the film was not good enough for that."
" One of the funniest movies I have ever seen. PERIOD.
",2020-02-15 00:00:00,10,"If you need a pick me up from a bad day, just watch this and you will definitely feel better about everything that may be going wrong in your life. Cameron and Jason are a hilarious couple."
" better than Kardashian's not as good as Tila Tequila's
",2019-11-22 00:00:00,5,"This movie is exactly what you expect it to be.It is that familiar Cameron Diaz character with that familiar Jason Segel character. And guess what? They make a sex tape and try to get it back. It's a fun little plot. You've got conflict and desperate scrambling by humans to reclaim a dominion over technology.The humour is...well, humour rather than comedy. No real jokes, just painful situations.Its sickly message of trying to not lose the spark from your relationships and making sure you don't lose touch with your family in the war it takes to manage them is not appreciated.But you get a butt stand in for Diaz. They picked well. She's my favourite member of the cast, yeah I said it."
" I like Diaz, a lot, but would skip it
",2019-11-16 00:00:00,2,"It didn't have anything to offer. The actor Jason Siegel is such a nut. It's a boring movie. I would recommend it to anyone. It seems to have a fun storyline. I couldn't get into it, and I tried a few times.3 stars"
" An OK film to watch on a Saturday night at home
",2019-10-04 00:00:00,7,"Not the most wonderful, earth shattering movie of course, but if you're looking for a movie to watch on a Saturday night at home while you're relaxing after a long week at work this won't disappoint you. It's basic but still interesting and captivating at rom-com level."
" Had Funny Moments Which Could've Been Much Deeper
",2019-07-30 00:00:00,6,"Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz star in this 2014 romantic comedy ""Sex Tape"" which demonstrates that making a sex rape is a lot more fun than seeing yourself in the act. It may not be a deeply provocative movie but it's still a film that will likely quench your curiosity.Diaz plays Annie Hargrove who reminisces to the time when the last time her husband Jay (Segel) has seen her naked. The audience is treated to a fun-filled expose of all the times they've got sexually active from their first encounter till the time they got married and then things just stopped from there.Jotting down on her blog, she recounts the reason why their sex life started going down. From having kids to balance and both having jobs, that's good enough reasons why they're sex life is on hold. Under Annie's determination, she suggests that she and Jay should engage in making a sex tape as a way to rectify the energy that was once lost after they tied the knot. But things don't go as planned as Annie wants those videos deleted, but instead he accidentally sends the video off to several Ipads as he tries to hunt down for them and the comedy takes off from there.Rob Lowe and Rob Corddry are the real standouts here who have some of the more funnier moments in the film. Corddry is Jay's friend Robby who is curious to see the tape and while Lowe is wonderful as Annie's boss Hank who speaks in annoying techno babble like a Steve Jobs just to stay hip and to be conncted with the modern audience. And though he runs a wholesome toy company, his most are anything but.Segel share penmanship to the story along with two other colleagues which include Nicholas Stoller and was based on a story by Kate Angelo. This movie is greatly inspired by the myriad of the ever popular romantic comedies that boarder raunchiness. The opening scenes reminds a lot like ""Neighbors"" which at times feels recycled and unoriginal. I'm sure they have originality in their veins. It's reason for the ""R"" rating is the chronic use of swearing. Sure it's okay to keep the story going that a few vulgar words will slip out just to keep it casual. But when it becomes too frequent it just feels juvenile especially during the more serious moments in the movie.There are genuine funny moments like the moments that centre around the performances from Corddry and Lowe. And sure scenes from before can propel the laugh moments that were well executed. At the end of the movie, we're treated to see snippets of the sex tape and they were surely to get some belly laughs.While not entirely an abomination, ""Sex Tape"" can be seen as a guilty pleasure at best. It had potential to be more deep but felt more compelled to be overly juvenile and vulgar."
" Sex Tape
",2019-07-20 00:00:00,6,6/10 - occasional laughs and charm made this one worth watching
" This movie is offensive to the sensibilities right off the bat!
",2019-07-07 00:00:00,1,In all honesty I hope that this very brief review which matches how long I could bare it still qualifies for being published on the site!I actually only lasted literally a minute and will not only never force myself to watch it again but highly don't recommend it!For some reason I thought that just because it described the pair in the movie as man and wife that it was going to be less solacious than the typical hook up film or a x rated one but apparently that wasn't the case and Ironically it was worse! I am talking a butt naked very raw sex scene that came off really staged and really rudimentary!
" Less funny than I expect
",2019-05-19 00:00:00,5,"From the first quarter I saw an inclination to the boring side.
The concept of the story was very promising. Unfortunatly the movie wasn't actually that good.
Recomended?
If your are trapped in a basement after a nuclear war, and this is the only tape you have available."
" High concept, poorly executed
",2019-05-08 00:00:00,4,"The film should have been better. When you consider the talent involved, this is an underwhelming film. The sentiment is lost in the end when the film is a chore to sit through. Odd film and just not the film it could have been. The cast are fun and the support cast are good, but the film is tiresome in the end."
" Just not funny
",2019-04-17 00:00:00,2,"Honestly, I seriously cannot believe how bad this movie was. Like, before watching this film I thought that it was only fundamentalist Christians who were obsessed with sex, but it turns out that this is not necessarily the case. Like honestly, I don't know if I have ever seen a film, that isn't pornographic, that is so obessed with sex. Well, there was Zack and Miri, but that is actually a romantic comedy, and it is also Kevin Smith, so I guess that can be excused. This film, well, no, this film really, really, really doesn't fall into that category.So, you can probably guess that this film is about a couple who happen to be addicted to sex, well they were addicted to sex right up until they got married and had kids, and suddenly discovered that it just wasn't happening any more. Well, to get a bit of a sparkle back into the relationship, they decided to record themselves having sex, and unfortunately it gets uploaded to the internet.Well, not quite, because it is only shared around their immediate friends who happen to have an iPad that is connected with each other. The thing is that despite them being young, and hip (she is a blogger), they still don't know their way around the devices. Honestly, that is absolutely ridiculous. Sure, it would be understandable if they were, well, my age, but these people seemed like they were in their early thirties, and were certainly quite tech savy in other regards. As such, I am not convinced, based on what was indicated in other parts of the film, that they would not have been able to prevent this video from being shared with all of their friends.Honestly, this film basically descended pretty quickly into one of those really bad low brow comedies where the jokes, if that is what you consider them to be, basically centre around sex and people getting hurt, and the people getting hurt is usually the male protagonist, which is the case in this film. Oh, yeah, and there is one scene where he is rushed to hospital because he voluntarily falls off of a balcony. Seriously, with the state of heathcare in the United States, and the fact that they were struggling to come up with $15,000 dollars earlier in the film, would have they been able to afford that care. Yeah, and with the circumstances surrounding the accident, I'm not convinced that his health insurance, if he actually had any health insurance, would have been willing to cover it.Yeah, I know, it's only a movie, but honestly, it is a pretty bad movie at that."
" i don't get the negative reviews. This film isn't the best, but its not the worst.
",2019-04-04 00:00:00,7,"Yes some could say the story line is silly, which to be fair, it kind of is. However, i found the story line quite believable. I know people that have have nude pictures or nude videos on their i phones that have been transferred to another device because of the i cloud sync, which doesn't surprise me . if you are new to apple products etc, how could you be aware of this. However, the part on the movie where they give the i pads away is a little silly. this movie could have been horrendous but, Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel are brilliant actors so the movie was good. However, I have to admit this isn't Cameron Diaz's best film and doesn't show how goof her acting can be . I think shes shows this in more serious roles such as my sisters keeper, and the holiday. Overall worth a watch, its not too intense so would be a good one to watch with friends."
" Wasted opportunity.
",2019-03-23 00:00:00,5,"This could have been so much better. The story-line is a little weak, and requires that the audience believe this couple was giving out iPads like they were business cards.As a farce comedy along the lines of 'Horrible Bosses' or 'Hall Pass', the casting of Jason Segel was a terrible mistake. He seems sullen and miserable and utterly unconvincing in this role. Ashton Kutcher or Jason Sudeikis might have elevated the whole mood of the film and worked with Cameron Diaz with much better chemistry.Seems very unfair that Diaz got a golden raspberry for worst actress; she was the saving grace of this poorly-written mess."
" Acted by robots.
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,3,"Still not comvinced that Jason Segal was in this movie. I am positive it was a robot version of him which would explain the lifeless performance he gave. Maybe he was intimidated by how hot Cameron Diaz is and how umbelievable it is thst they are married. Despite the whole movie feeling like it was also writtend, directed and edited by robots because of the stale and bland nature of every aspect of the lovie, it does have one of my favorite scenes of all time! Thank god for the little girl that plays there daughter or this movie would have receieved zero stars from me."
" Career Killer
",2019-02-09 00:00:00,1,Have you ever wondered why you haven't heard anything from from these two actors in a few years? Watch this movie and you'll wonder no more. Just terrible. I watched it on broadcast TV with commercial breaks. The commercials were better than the film.
" Bad story
",2019-01-30 00:00:00,4,This is a typical American comedy movie that just goes to far the premise is good but the execution is poor which is a shame as it could have been very good
" Dumb
",2019-01-16 00:00:00,2,"As soon as that Howard kid step in and saying some dumb things, I had to stop watching the movie... it was too dumb"
" Very funny movie
",2018-12-25 00:00:00,10,My girlfriend and I have laughed a lot. Don't be irritated by the rating!
" THE FULL LINCOLN
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,4,"Jay (Jason Segal) and Annie (Cameron Diaz) have sex. They don't talk, have romance or foreplay that we know about. We really don't get to know the couple even after they have two kids and get bored with sex. They make a sex tape and accidentally download it to a bunch of I-Pads that he gave away to to a group of friends...must be nice.The rest of the film is their attempt to recover the I-Pads.The clever humor wasn't there. It was all situational nonsense that was made worse through the lack of decent dialogue. For instance they relate their super sex lives to sports players. He claims to be the ""Shaq"" of sex. Okay, first person that comes to my mind would be A-Rod. You have an overt sexual reference plus a personal Diaz connection. At this point she comes up with a clever line that integrates her relationship and the film. Instead the writers dropped the ball, as I felt they did the entire film.The film has got plenty of F-bombs and sex. The nudity consists of butts and side breasts. No real Diaz nudity...sorry about the spoiler."
" ""Delete the .MP4 file.""
",2018-10-11 00:00:00,1,"Sex Tape isn't a pleasant comedy to watch. It's awkwardly timed, written, and portrayed even with its seemingly interesting list of actors known for their comedic attributes. However, the film merely utilizes their potential with middling effort that leads into middling results. It follows a married couple who were previously sexually active until obtaining offspring. Their story involves an unfortunate incident with their recorded sexually explicit adventures being accidentally shared to others without their consent or knowledge.During their strange adventure to find any device, and anyone withholding the devices, that contains the file sounds intriguing but ends with endless humdrum ideas. Their problem could easily be resolved but their predicament is foolishly approached with overly ridiculous encounters. There's many instances of interesting ideas but they're treated like a terribly written sitcom and cartoon merged together.Although badly written, some smaller redeeming qualities come from the performances from the leading actors. Their ballsy devotion to the film's premise is deeply shocking but also strangely charming. Their chemistry balances the profoundly dumb ideas throughout but also harms their performances as it makes them seem dumber than the writing. Stupidity seems to be encouraged in this story as nobody either sensibly speaks or acts sooner to prevent any unwanted dilemmas.It's a brainless comedy about sex that makes the sex less appealing. It's not funny enough to make sex acceptably awkward. It's not carefully crafted to allow the actors to explore interesting elements into this awkward story. But worst of all, it's just not sexy enough to be a worthwhile porno. It would be easier to just search for real sexually explicit videos elsewhere with their badly produced content to actually feel justified. Just delete the .MP4 file. Three hours of lust sounds like a horrific wet dream."
" Cameron Diaz Goes Ghetto
",2018-07-31 00:00:00,1,"America's sweetheart turns into a rap-loving, F bomb, A bomb and S bomb spouting shrew. Segal also cannot get through a sentence without the same. Since that has become a substitute for good writing, funny lines, and a clever story in most films today, I was not surprised. But they are a family in this travesty, with little kids, yet they think it is hilarious being low-life scum bags. Why? Because shocking and drowning the middle class with the most amoral behavior became Hollywood's mission during the Obama era. Of course, every other film is a race bait, anti-white tirade of some sort they all believe we deserve after $2 trillion in programs we paid for aimed at minorities, and subjecting ourselves to a school curriculum with no educational purpose other than shaming Americans. This puerile, vile, hate speech targeted at those few of us that still believe this is a great country, will make traditional people nauseous. Parents who believe they should raise kids with good values should write all of these people off, including actors, directors, producers and other Hollywood miscreants."
" Sex Tape: Throw something heavy at your T.V. if you run across by accident while channel hopping.

The I-pad goes missing, so they need to go find it fast!During their frantic search they get up to all sorts of shenanigans. It's not good, it's really bad, and it isn't very funny. You could go make a cuppa, or distract yourself for longer and not miss anything.I wouldn't even recommend renting or downloading.Throw something heavy at your T.V. if you run across by accident while channel hopping."
" Funny in parts, but nothing special
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,5,"'Sex Tape' is a quick, simple comedy with a good cast. Very straightforward storyline - married couple with kids tries to get the romance back, so they decide to film themselves having sex. It then is synced to all their friends' iPads and they have to retrieve them. I would like to say hilarity then ensues, but it doesn't.The cast, mostly Segel & Diaz, plus Corddry & Kemper, Lowe & Black are all quite charming/engaging in their own way, but the main fault with the film is that it's all been done before. Sure, it's a new premise, but it's based on the same old ""couple-trying-to-get-their-mojo-back"" plot and sadly there's not that many laughs to be had. A few chuckles here and there, but no truly funny laugh-out-loud moments.Basically, the best bits are in the trailer and if you're going hoping to see nudity, there's - unfortunately - plenty of Segel's butt! That is counteracted by a little bit of Diaz's butt & side-boob, but nothing to really write home about!"
" Disappointing mess
",2017-11-03 00:00:00,2,It jokes to much and is not serious at all and a certain scene was so bad that it shouldn't even be in the movie. This is one of the worst high budget movies I've ever seen the only good it has is the quality(like video and sound not story wise) and the actors. The movie has jokes for toddlers yet it is made for adults. 3/10
" Not bad at all!!
",2017-08-15 00:00:00,5,"The movie is predicable, the actors are good, the plot is average and sometimes funny, but Cameron Diaz is sexy in the tape, it pay itself for the movie, of course l won't willing to pay the DVD or Blu-ray disc, on Netflix is cheaper, forgettable comedy where sniff cocaine is cool, politically incorrect certainly, if they needs it to increase to make love, the world is lost!!!Resume:First watch: 2017 / How many: 1 / Source: Netflix / Rating: 5"
" Good actors, worst scenario
",2017-06-27 00:00:00,1,Both main characters are known with their good acting. But i m still surprised how they accepted this porn related inartistic scenario.After watching it i asked myself what i learned or what i remembered? Only remembered thing is people don't make sex after children. Can anyone say me so what?
" Better than the majority of reviews say
",2017-05-29 00:00:00,7,"This film really got slammed hard negatively by critics when it was released in 2014. It stars well known actors Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel. I really liked the casting decisions, Diaz and segal have great romantic chemistry and I liked seeing them work together to get back every last IPad from their family and friends before they open up the sex tape that's on them. The whole premise for the movie is of course an absolute nightmare for anyone, especially when they're a 40 year old married couple with children and images to keep up for their careers. The movie's script provided a lot of good funny lines of dialogue and comical moments that were uplifted by the cast's talent. I really don't understand the people that didn't enjoy this movie, I thought it was very funny, well acted, and well written. And when I say well acted and well written, I don't mean that it's gonna win any big fancy awards, but still, it does its job of entertaining the audience and making you laugh when you to. One might not think that a film like this would have any heartfelt scenes, but it actually does. There are moments that focus Annie and Jay's marriage and why they felt the need to film a sex tape in the first place. I thought this film worked and accomplished what it set out to. 7/10 for Sex Tape."
" Not very funny, but saved by the relatively short running time
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,3,"I watched this on TV, hoping for some comedic relief. Diaz and Segel play Annie and Jay, a married couple longing for the hot sex of their youth. After a long marriage and two kids they decide to re-kindle the spark by filming their cavorting in all the positions of ""The Joy of Sex"".The film goes on the ""cloud"" and it must be retrieved before friends and neighbors can watch it. The operation is further complicated by the fact that Jay donates ""old"" iPads to friends and syncs his stuff. I laughed a few times, although the plot started to loose steam when Annie and Jay spent a very long time at Annie's boss house. The story wraps up with a visit to YouPorn servers' warehouse and a school presentation - the very last gag. Besides being only moderately funny, the dialogue is crammed with more swearing than a Tarantino movie. I am not sure if American middle-aged couples talk to each other like that, but it did seem excessiveI used to like Cameron Diaz but lately she seems to have given up and playing only vulgar and/or predictable. The saving grace is the relatively short running time of one hour and 30 minutes."
" Why.
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,2,"After seeing the Marines United scandal all over the internet, I decided to indulge in this dumpster fire (Currently on Netflix, for any other masochists).Now, I've always liked Jason Segel as an actor. He has his own style of comedy that he's polished over the last ten years, and not to mention he's an adequate screenwriter.That said, I don't know what happened here. It's like some scientist grew this Jason Segel clone from a test tube. Only a skinnier, painfully unfunny version of him. He somehow even manages to stumble over dialogue that he wrote for himself.Making matters worse is the fact that Segel and Diaz have zero chemistry together.I've never really understood Cameron Diaz's fame. Even as a child I noticed she was an awful actress. Checking out her recent work, one will see that she's on a streak of poorly reviewed films. Go big or go home, I guess.Her performance in this is nothing short of embarrassing. Some scenes (the part where Diaz comes up with the sex tape idea, and the part where Segel tells her the video was sent to their friends, in particular) seem so amateur it's astonishing they didn't do more takes.The whole film has a rushed feel to it. Plot holes, characters doing things without any motives whatsoever, and the feature's failure to comprehend the basic functions of the devices themselves. (Technology is a center point to the movie but for whatever reason they make no attempt to structure this component accurately). There are periods in the script where one has to wonder if it was written by a twelve year old boy.There's a line early on that displays this best; ""My **** can see the future, that's why I call it Nostra****mus."" Cameron Diaz is seen fully nude from the back not even two minutes into the film (Spoiler: you're not missing anything) and this happens periodically, like they were trying to reach a quota.The music in this movie if it's not stock music they sure tried. There was a moment where I thought my afghan burner phone was ringing. (THIS IS NOT A JOKE THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED) The lighting in this movie is a mess. Normally I just notice well lit films. If it's nothing special I'll note it as ""Whatever"" but this needs to be talked about. There are scenes where the lighting is so aggressive you feel like you're watching a stage play. Shiny foreheads, overly white light in a dimly lit living room its just a train-wreck.The editing in this film, MY GOD THE EDITING. Every single conversation is littered with a barrage of quick cuts. In between conversations, the shots are stale and flat like everything else.The only interesting thing going on here was the flip flop of it's stance on Apple's products. (The interesting bit is behind the fourth wall. Nothing worthwhile going on inside them) I'm confused as to what side of the fence it wants to be on. One minute the couple is upset about the device automatically sending the sex video to their friends and family, the next minute Segel is praising the physical design like he's in a commercial. One scene has him discarding an iPad out a bedroom window, only to later reclaim it from the ground, exclaiming ""Man the construction of these things is unbelievable."" Another part has him looking at the footage they recorded on the iPad, stating ""It's like the best camera ever."" Of course since Segel was involved in the creative process, it has his signature serious moments dealing with relationships and feelings and all that. (Just being an ass) It worked in Sarah Marshall but it ain't doing the trick here. It's forced and cringe as hell.I don't want to use the word ""redeeming quality"" here because it's impossible to save this heap. But the few laughs this got out of me came from the main couple's married friends. Rob Corddry and Ellie Kemper (Lou – Hot Tub Time Machine, Erin – The Office, respectably) do their best and actually manage (somewhat) to out-deliver the awkward jokes that Segel and Diaz could not.Oh, the dog slamming into the wall after stepping on the treadmill, and the ensuing guilt from Segel was pretty good. ""Hey, are you okay?"" Lmao I'd tell you to avoid this one. But chances are, if you're even reading my reviews you already knew to stay away from this trash long before I typed this up.2/10 Utter trash."

If this sounds like you then you will probably enjoy this bawdy comedy.Our ordinary couple Annie and Jay finally get some time to themselves, as Mrs C would say, ""...to get Frisky!"" Only trouble is they just can't perform as neither of their hearts are in it and they're not in the mood. Then they have the wonderful idea of making a ""Sex Tape"" using their iPad. With the thought of this little bit of kinkiness, the clothes come off and the evenings fun begins. For four hours straight they act out all the Joy of Sex positions.The next day, feeling less stressed and considerably happy Jay learns that the tape has been sent to all his business clientele, for whom he'd given iPods that were synced to his own. He'd even given the postman one for Christmas and it was his e-mail saying how much he'd enjoyed the video that drops the penny in Jay's skull.From here on in it's a race to delete all the movies before people can see them, especially Annie's new boss Hank, played by Rob Lowe.American comedy has a potential to be immature and puerile when it comes to sex, staying in the realms of ""toilet"" humour. However, this film is a couple of notches above that and, at times, is quite funny with an adult resolve. The cast do an excellent job, especially Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel in the lead roles. It's the story and direction which let the story down, though. There's not enough laughs in the main body of the film to really carry it and it could have done with some more twists and turns. Strange thing is, the funniest part of the film, which had me laughing my arse off, was at the end of the movie. It's the sex scene's from the ""Sex Tape"" Annie and Jay make. Why the director decided to put them at the end of the movie is a quandary as, had they been in the scene where they make the video, it would've added some much-needed laughter at the correct point in the film. This is a major fail in a comedy film. However, they didn't make the cutting room floor, and they really did make me howl, so I upped the score of the film.This is a fun film to watch with your loved one, especially if you're middle-aged and can relate to the situation."
