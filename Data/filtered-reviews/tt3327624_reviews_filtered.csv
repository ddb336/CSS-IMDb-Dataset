" Boring
",2021-03-16 00:00:00,2,"Starts of bearable, but then just decends into seemingly repetitive dialogue, and uninteresting violence. I just lost all interest and all hope in this film, and was not saved as it progressed. Indeed it did not progress into anything but lots of talking and fighting that won't even interest the gore and action fans among you. It lacks atmosphere, and everything just feels long-winded. Would have been a much better 20 minute film."
" Middling Muddled Sci Fi Film
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,4,"Mildly entertaining sci fi film with ok performances from the actors but the inconclusive ending was annoying.
Skip this and watch Alien instead."
" Australia always delivers sci fi
",2021-01-23 00:00:00,8,"Wow! great acting; seriously great actors choices for unknown, filthy, bloody, alien etc...It is like everything you hate about american sci fi was done right. Australia knows sci fi!!"
" Calm down everyone
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,6,"Two things annoyed me about this movie.
First, the middle section where each character wrestles with their conscience is just tedious and overdone.
Secondly, when the travellers are 'slipstreamed' back to earth they are subjected to harassment and haranguing by really annoying quarantine personnel who keep asking them to ""calm down"", and ""answer the question"", in a really aggressive manner without giving them any realistic chance to ""calm down"". Instead, they interrupt them, repeat the (already answered) questions, and just plain freakin' annoy the hell out of the already stressed returned travellers. Good to see basic psychology and human interaction skills have come a long way in 300 years."
" A good sunday B movie
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,6,"As others have mentioned: this is not the tidiest or most origional film on the planet, but has its moments. It seems to have improved with age, though that may be more a reflection of the sad state of sci-fi or sci-fi/horror these days..."
" Interesting, suspenseful, & entertaining without being TOO derivative
",2020-12-25 00:00:00,7,"I loved this movie! Yes, it borrows heavily from other sci-fi horrors - Pandorum, Event Horizon, Prometheus, The Thing, Resident Evil, a pinch of 28 Days Later - but it was still unique enough to keep me on my toes with some creative new ideas. And the main character (Whit Carmichael) is extremely sympathetic and engaging. Not a lot of character development beyond Whit, but it's his story. Not much else is needed. Cool sets, atmospheric lighting, good acting and effects - really well done. I would have liked a little more development of some of the sciencey details and maybe fewer ""leaps"" in logic without enough explanation. But that's an issue for me with almost all movies in the sci-fi horror subgenre (I love dorky exposition). The bar is low with this sort of movie, and I always go in hoping for the best but expecting a sub-par knockoff of better films. I think Infini works as a stand-alone - a fairly original take on a familiar idea."
" Liked the idea
",2020-11-18 00:00:00,5,"The basis of the plot is a good one, though not original. The movie movie had a few plus points, but the negatives were big. 1. Will writers/ directors please ,stop making every contagion a zombie / rabid virus, try using some imagination. 2. The pace of the movie was at times excruciatingly slow. 3. Why do Science Fiction horror movies almost all follow either Alien, Event Horizon or the Thing, and some follow all 3. There are plenty of great writers out there with originality, stop playing safe, it's boring."
" Wow
",2020-11-10 00:00:00,10,I have watched many sci fi movies if not all and this is a very good one. The budget doesn't hinder it at all the acting is great and the story will get to you.
" Entertaining
",2020-09-07 00:00:00,7,"Good concepts and action. Solid performances, even funny at times in a good way when they went for it. Worth a watch over takeout if you like gritty action with zombies or whatever. Could be an 8 but it needed a deus ex machina ending to wrap things up and bring the team home."
" NICE TRY BUT A POOR COPYCAT OF HOLLYWOOD CLASSICS
",2020-08-07 00:00:00,3,"For an Aussie film pretending to be an American film its not a bad effort.
But there is no compelling story here. Weak script so executing a weak script
results in a weak story. Lots pf good action and effects but means nothing when
your characters are not interesting. This is a bad mashup of Event Horizon, Aliens and other great hollywood classics. So fedup with bad ripoffs. Get original."
" A vivid psychological horror
",2020-07-03 00:00:00,7,The first half is terrific with a dark and ominous setup. The second half lags a little and dwells on the relentless psychological descent of the key players. But the direction is punchy and stylish and the low profile cast very effective. An alternative underground sci-fi thriller.
" Who cares?
",2020-06-25 00:00:00,3,Some people you won't care about run around shouting a lot for reasons you won't understand. Don't waste your time.
" I'll watch it again.
",2020-05-14 00:00:00,8,"It's very intense, gotta say that. But the action is superb, the acting is just great. The lead actor's performance is quite affecting. All the characters are believable.. There isn't a lot of room for character development but I do feel that I got to know the characters maybe even more than the minimum required, so no complaints there. What an interesting concept for the plot, and you can live with the ending. What I got out of it, without giving spoilers, is that it's about life. I'll watch it again - it's that good."
" Way better than a 5.4 rating
",2020-05-12 00:00:00,8,"That's the rating at the time of this review. Is it event horizon? No. But it's quite entertaining with a very interesting plot. Sure, one or two bad actors are apparent. But people seem to think this was a multimillion dollar, triple A release. It's not.This is a hidden gem. This is why I sit through bad movies. To find movies like this. I recommend it."
" Worth a watch (Lockdown 2020)
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,7,"I wasn't expecting much from this movie and I was pleasantly surprised. You need a bit of imagination to go along with the story line, as you do with most sci-fi movies. I think the actors did a good job and the cinemography was also good.Whoever reviews this 1* or 2* shouldn't be reviewing movies!"
" Worth watching but keep your expectations low
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,5,"No spoilers....The story starts with an interesting premise but quickly falls apart in a jumbled mismash of scifi tropes.Given the poor script, the actors were exceptional and carry the weight of the movie forward.Sound design was excellent, and set construction was good given the low budget.Fight scenes were executed flawlessly, yet painfully drawn out. They could have edited them all to half their length.The third and final act was lacking... almost inconsistent with the tone and direction of the first two acts. It's like they ran out of plot.Still, there are many worse scifi movies than this. Would have been a 6,maybe 6.5, if the story was a little more solid."
" Budget Australian Sci-Fi exceeds expectations
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,7,"More interesting and engaging than the current 5.4 rating at the time of viewing suggested. While it doesn't hold up against the epic sci-fi films, it doesn't try too hard to be something it's not. Decent premise, plot, characters and set design making it worth a watch"
" If the Doom movie with The Rock was rebooted, it would be this
",2020-04-08 00:00:00,6,A decent watch overall boosted heavily by the acting and set design. Shows a lot of unnecessary horror. Almost a carbon copy of the Doom movie.Was refreshing to see people not do stupid stuff like in other typically sci-fi or horror movies.
" Little gem with huge potential
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,10,"Sometimes I wonder whether I've seen the same movie as certain critics.
This movie has a few probs with narrative cohesion and fairly dodgy CGIs till about half way through but then it settles down into a spectacular little sci-fi attempt, both paying homage to the genre and treading new ground. The slipstream idea is a little on the nose but the third act lifts the whole thing up to an atmospheric and moral level equal to the best of them, indeed reminiscent of Alien. The themes of conflict and confrontation with an invisible enemy and the ambitious taking on of this enemy with human courage and forbearance by the protagonist are superbly done. The physical manifestation of the said enemy in the field of vision of the protagonist creates ambiguity and complexity at the end. They all get back home safely or do they? I wish the first two acts had been able to find their feet as successfully as the third act. And the shorter, chunkier Hemsworth, not quite as much of a celebrity as his taller matinee idol siblings, is quite a revelation. He has the makings of an outstanding character actor and I hope suitable projects in the pipeline bear him in mind. Ten stars for the protagonist, for Luke, for a superb third act and for the sheer pluck and cheek of this little gem. I hope the creative team behind it bravely go where no sci-fi flick has gone before."
" 'Deja Vu' all over this derivative film cash in.
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,6,A derivative plot/premise (Prometheus/Crazies/X-Files/Event Horizon etc etc) that is brought down by a basic script and utterly inexplicable editing.
" Surprisingly good Sci-Fi flick!
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,7,"This is not a blockbuster, big budget sci-fi extravaganza, nor does it pretend to be.
It IS a good, solid sci-fi movie that may seem to borrow from other stories, but has enough originality and sufficiently high production values to make it well worth watching.Forget the averaged rating, if you like sci-fi with a touch of horror or mysterious events, eatch this and make up your own mind. I nearly gave it an 8, would definitely have given it a 7.5 if I could have."
" Kmart Quality
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,5,These movie is like a Kmart quality stuff... waste of movie and time!
" Is this the next ALIEN??
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,6,"01.04.2020. I just watched this movie. A bit sl9w in places, but comes together at the end."
" How can I take this movie seriously?
",2020-02-06 00:00:00,3,"When the entire cast is comprised of well-known Australian actors (great in their home turf), with the most awful and stereotypical American accents I've ever heard! Normally Aussies are well know for mimicking any accent successfully... not this time!I guess my question are; who thought it was a good idea for all cast members of an Australian movie to try and sound American? Was it because the setting was in space? Did the director and producer believe that maybe having the cast talk with the most phoney American accents ever would add validity to a b grade movie about manipulative zombies in space???I am beyond confused..."
" Triumph of Liberalism
",2019-09-15 00:00:00,6,"Zombies fight each other for supremacy, as if we would care who wins. But then a good talking-to brings around the biological irrational to the Correct perspective, and the Whig view of history triumphs. Vive l'individu !"
" pretty good flick
",2019-06-09 00:00:00,7,The organism makes you think they made multi copies of these people and finally got it right. Which is downright spooky!
" Sci Fi blender
",2019-05-16 00:00:00,7,"Limited budget done right.My only negative point is, the script can't keep up the good promise it's building, in the final half hour. If these guys had the budget of one of the ultra boring new Star Wars movies, God knows what would have happened.The blender references is actually a thumbs up. Take a bit of everything (horror, psychological and so on) and make it work. Love it.The atmosphere is perfect, the entire movie, it's an art.
The acting is good, not stellar, but nobody drags the movie down, so the entire cast delivers. Enjoyed it. CG are good and support the movie and it's not a movie build around CG.Whoever did the music of the movie, I was sublime."
" TIME TO EVOLVE
",2019-05-10 00:00:00,8,"Plot spoiler explanation. Not ending.In the 23rd century, the world has developed teleportation they call ""slip streaming"" a title already taken. There are risks associated with slip streaming as sometimes the molecules don't come back together correctly. This fact creates an alternative explanation for the events, similar to ""Total Recall.""Whit Carmichael (Daniel MacPherson) is part of a special operations police force. They slip stream to remote mining planets to deal with issues. An event happens on the remotest location ""Infini"" which causes his operation on earth to be quarantined and destroyed. Whit manages to slip stream to Infini, the source of the problem. A rescue team shows up and find Infini shutdown and dead bodies all over the place.There appears to be an infection which causes people to kill. We discover (Plot spoiler part) they were mining frozen primordial ooze, a living organic rock which acts like a parasite and causes the host to go into predator mode, killing other people. Unfortunately much of the film is devoted to people in the predator mode hunting each other at Infini, which became boring after a while.It seems Infini, like every nearly planet and moon in science fiction has the exact same gravity as Earth. They can send extraction signals from Infini to Earth, send people between the two locations, but are unable to send messages. The dialogue and acting was stiff, a characteristic of too many sci-fi books and films that concentrate on plot. Science fiction fans should like this film whereas casual sci-fi viewers might get bored.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
" Topsy Turvey Sci Fi/Horror Ride
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,8,"10 September 2015. This is one of the few movies one has to bear with it to the end to come to possible appreciate it as a whole. Besides a pretty lousy set design that comes across as one of the neatest poverty stricken sets and ancient 50s and 60s technology of the future, and an Event Horizon (1997) disaster in the making, Infini somehow manages to crawl out of chaos to actually make a pretty decent landing in the end. With elements from Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986) as well as a theme from Solaris (1972, 2002), Infini's use of an elite rescue squad manages to hold up much better than most sci fi military based scripts though it stumbles in a few places. Perhaps the close companion movie might be Cuba Gooding Jr.'s The Devil's Tomb (2009). There were places in the movie that seemed boringly extended, chaotic and directionless as well as the acting. Yet by the end of the movie there is a strong surrealistic twisting element that could have been executed a bit better but overall, really redeems the movie."
" Is it like Event Horizon? No, but better than Alien Covenant.
",2018-07-01 00:00:00,6,"I watched this movie after somebody said it's similar to Event Horizon. Is it? Well, it's in the same vein, using inter-dimensional travel to create the horror of ""unknown"".. but the ""horror"" isn't really that horrifying.Don't get me wrong, it's still far more competent and entertaining than the pile of sh*t that Prometheus and Alien: Covenant were. Just don't expect it to match Event Horizon.Primarily because, like with most directors/writers, in Infini, they make the mistake of trying to explain too much. Even bigger mistake is to show the enemy itself, but then it'd have to be a psychological horror, which this ain't.Also, I would've preferred they had ended the movie when the hero ""wakes up"" (not a spoiler) instead of them showing more. It'd left the ending up the interpretation, like they say they wanted to.. but I don't think it does. Kinda explains pretty clearly what happened and who changed and why. Kinda disappointed in that.Oh well, still a good movie. Worth watching."
" AWESOME Sci-Fi
",2018-06-01 00:00:00,10,"I actually put off watching this movie for 2 years before I finally bit the bullet. I felt the story line was too Cliche, I'm tired of Zombies and Body Snatcher movies.That being said WOW!!!!! I was totally blown away by this movie. I went a tad bit overboard with the 10 due to all the negative votes but it is clearly at least a 9. I can't go into details because it would spoil the ending but WOW, Clearly Amazing. One of the best Sci-Fi space movies I've ever seen.I recommend watching this movie."
" Interesting and entertaining - recommended
",2018-05-22 00:00:00,8,"Not sure why it has a 5.4. It was definitely entertaining and interesting throughout. The acting was above par and intense. All stories have been told before and this one is no exception. The way it is told is unique and it has a twist ending which you do not see coming. For a $5 Million budget you get a $50 million dollar movie. Not sure if this had wide or even limited release, but it deserves it. Director Shane Abbess is an exceptional talent and I hope more people watch it (on Netflix). This story has been told many times before but largely without the talent present here. I rate it in the top 10% of the best SciFi movies. Enjoy!"
" Crap gets real
",2018-04-18 00:00:00,8,"So, this movie is really about one dude really. Yes, there is a whole group, but its really about him. Its about him, and what would he do to not only take care of his family, but get back to them.They live in a world where 95% of ppl are at or below the poverty line. So, he takes a job that is hella dangerous so that he can take care of his family. It also happens to be that this job includes slip streaming, think teleportation, via a implant in their neck. Of course, like all movies like this, the first day on the job, gets real.The main character, Whit Carmichael, is forced to illegally slip, to a mining colony, that also just happens to be under attack from something. A whole center of slip streamers is dead, because of what came back from that mining colony. So, what do we do? We send MORE people. Not only are they going to fetch Whit, but it turns out that, that mining colony is going to send us a killer package.I get feelings of Event Horizon, The Thing, some Alien tossed in. If you enjoy movies that have space paranoia, blood, aliens, and interesting tech, this maybe a good pick for you. Now, the story, acting and cinematic are wonderful in what is my opinion, a sci-fi horror movie. Its out of Australia, and every time I am blown away by a movie, it seems to of come from here.. It of course had it's bloody moments, but unlike some horror movies it's part of the story line. The blood, is part of the story line.Quickly you fall in love with some characters, and others you hate right away. But, don't get attached to anyone. Like, anyone.I would highly, highly, highly, suggest y'all taking the almost 2 hours to watch this one."
" Blow you mind out of this world film.
",2018-01-29 00:00:00,10,From the get go you knew you were in for a real sci-fy ride. I will not put any spoilers here cause it is just that good.
" What a mess
",2018-01-25 00:00:00,1,"No original ideas in this movie.
Space troops transport to creepy space station, find dead people, get infected, become space zombies, get killed, get re animated and cured and back to earth. Plenty of fake blood, screaming and flashbacks/hallucinations? Lame!"
" A Solid SciFi B Movie
",2018-01-11 00:00:00,3,"I found this SciFi to quite entertaining. Although somewhat low-budget, which is why I would rank it as a ""B"" film, the moral premise and script were rather unique and the acting was quite good. It held some gripping, suspenseful moments as well as several thrills and was thought provoking throughout. What more could a SciFi buff ask for?"
" A highly ambitious trip to the Stars results into tripping down the stairs
",2017-12-19 00:00:00,5,"A Movie filled with known Story, Plot devices and Atmosphere, or as one Reviewer put it ""The Crazies in Space"". While this might be true in some fashion or another it oversimplifies the whole experience, if one would describe it with 3 Movies you could say it kind of is a mix of ""Alien"" (1979) (for most of the Atmosphere and corporate business critique on a Ship, and Sending a Team to check whats going on), ""The Thing"" (1982) (for its Paranoia between the main characters, and whose actions are driven by it) & ""The Signal"" (2007) (& Last but not least this little Horror Indie Gem, for its Signal that drives people into Psychotic Maniacs attacking each other).The biggest complain i have with this Film is that while not being the most unique Film of its genre, it sure shows its potential, because you can see from the get-go that the Movie suffers from a way too tiny Budget. You can see it on the Sets, on the sfx and even hear it on its Score, but still with all the cheap looking sets you can see what could have been if the minuscule Budget of 800K was pushed to 5 Million. There are lots of Scenes where you can see the Beauty in Lighting and Color, Camera movements and even some acted out Scenes by the protagonists and their conflicts. Another complain is the Actor of the Main-Character, while he is not the best actor (and not that bad either) there still are a couple of scenes where he overreacts or simply reacts a certain way which does not really suit the Scene (this could also be put on the Directors corner), This Actor would have been better suited if he had a different Role.Its not the most original Work, but it is hard to come by a decent Scifi Flick at this day and Age, so if you are a Hardcore Scifi Horror Fan, suit yourself and enjoy the Ride, as for my part i enjoyed the Film and em looking forward to what the Director is working on in the Future and hope that he will work himself up to a Point where he gets a Higher Budget to which he can better tell a Story."
" Good B SciFI from the outback
",2017-09-12 00:00:00,7,This is the best low rent flick I've seen in years. If you watched it for the hems don't hes not the star or even one of the known ones. If you liked Pandorum or any other mostly psychological thriller with planet x for backdrop. Surprisingly well acted and very unsettling cinematography.
" There are no zombies in this movie
",2017-07-10 00:00:00,6,"Typical bad reviews for this movie read like a 3rd grade book report: I didn't like this because I've seen better zombies... I didn't pay any attention to the rest of the movie.Here is how the adults do it. Biggest problem with this movie is because it was familiar. I get the Event Horizon angle. I also get a similar feeling from Doom. Alien? Maybe. Take away all of the inanimate objects from Alien or Aliens and there are only some rare similarities left. No terror. No Bishop. No power-loader. Hell yes to battling demons.This is not a shocking and gory horror film in which you hope your favorite survives to the end. Instead, it's a trippy sci-fi thriller which has two goals to interest viewers. First, figure out what's dangerous to the characters. Second, have an acid flashback. This genera is difficult to follow for the young and the sober, which explains most of the negative reviews. That also explains most of the 10+ reviews.There are many major flaws in this film which would normally jail it in B movie territory, for sure. But, unlike many other B movies, trash talking it and gem spotting are so easy.There's almost no background given on most characters. You might miss some if you don't have subtitles turned on. On the flip, you can watch it with friends and take a drink when a character dies because nobody cares.Here are the numbers:Acting: 9/10 One of the best gems is how the actors crush their performances.Dialogue: 8/10 Troopers out of their minds, trying to express something, makes some strange poetry. Whit and his wife are perfect.Music: 2/10 Only way to get a worse rating is if there was no music...Premise: 4/10 Why are there so many pseudo-important people who then take up a lot of time by saying unimportant things only to disappear for half, if not all of the movie?Story Development: 9/10 Happy ending?Comedy: 4/10 Many respectable attempts. I laughed once.Sets: 7/10 Wait, didn't he just run and duck past that same steam vent before? I guess that happens because every room in sci-fi has to be small. Detail was good and functional.Effects: 6/10 Talcum and dried blood are the only makeups. Functional for visual and sound.Cinematography: 8/10 Camera operator should get a raise.Editing: 7/10 Why is a dirty jump called a dirty jump? I get the feeling that half of the movie was cut out to shrink it down to only two hours.Grade: 64/100 Rounds down to a 6/10. If you are a fan of sci-fi, then don't miss this one."
" Very enjoyable, but not enough character development.
",2017-06-22 00:00:00,7,"While some of the budget shortcuts are obvious (hey, we've seen this hallway a dozen times already), they spent the money where it counts. The performances are mostly excellent, but the actors weren't given enough to do with the characters. They were given diverse motivations and hinted at interesting backstories but then very little time was spent exploring them. It was just all a tease. The film would've been better had it not felt the need for excessive chasing and fighting. I preferred the psychological tension versus the physical threats. The film didn't trust its audience. They had the potential for a great brainy sci-fi film, but felt it necessary (investors maybe?) to add some cheap action.Final conclusion: Worth checking out"
" Forget the ""5.4 out of 10"" -- this is a great film.
",2017-06-09 00:00:00,9,"Look, with the exception of the so-so acting of one or two minor characters, this is a fantastic dark sci - fi film. The special effects are great and the acting, for the most part, is great also. It is definitely worth a watch on Netflix or renting it out. The ending also threw me for a loop."
" surprised
",2017-05-18 00:00:00,8,"I watched this movie as a ""same old syfy"" ... until near the end, when things became not-so- average. I'm impressed. The writers gave some thought to the story - it's different. I would buy this movie. It's not for kids. The actors did a good job. The computer graphics are worthy of being noted. I wish that the scene location had been a bit different, but I don't know where I would suggest. I didn't get the 'thing' between the husband {main actor} and his pregnant wife."
" So uber-violent that you might wanna consider this before you watch.
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,5,"Before you watch ""Infini"" you need to seriously consider if it's a film you could handle...or would want to handle. After all, it's incredibly bloody and violent--so much so that it's bound to turn off some viewers. Sure,...it's sci-fi...but very violent and difficult to watch sci-fi. And I am talking about a film that is significantly more violent than ""Alien"" or ""The Thing"".When the film begins, there's a prologue that explains about the future and space travel through something called 'slipstreaming'. Soon a slipstreaming experiment goes amok and all but one of the slipstream soldiers on a base are killed when a group of slipstream travelers return--violent and changed into killing machines. The lone survivor, Whit, travels to the most distant and awful base set up by the humans, Infini.Soon an extraction group is sent to Infini. They are looking for survivors because apparently some sort of disaster occurred there. However, the disaster is nothing like the slipstream soldiers were told, as some weird alien creature that looks like goo takes over many in the team and they run amok killing each other. And, somehow, Whit is among the survivors...one of the few left alive after the infestation. Much of the film shows him battling crazed humans who are infested and it's killing---very, very violent, visceral and nasty killing for here on in the film.There are some very positive things about the movie. Although it cost only $800,000, it looked like the film cost many millions. It has nice special effects and music as well. But the film is a bit confusing (especially at the beginning) and just too bloody and violent for my taste. An interesting film but one that left me feeling a bit disappointed due to the unrelenting violence.By the way, it is interesting that although the film was made in Australia, all the folks sport American-style accents...even though a good deal of the actors are Aussies. Perhaps this was done to increase the ability of the filmmakers to market the picture abroad."
