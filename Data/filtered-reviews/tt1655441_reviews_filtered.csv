" Heartwarming
",2021-04-07 00:00:00,10,"One of the loveliest love stories I have ever witnessed on screen. Lively was phenomenal in this role, I honestly could not critique her portrayal of the character. Seriously worth your time, highly recommended."
" Ridiculous scientific defination but nice directed.
",2021-03-29 00:00:00,7,The scientific defination of immortality or whatever you may say it is totally ridiculous. They coud have used totlly fantacy instead. Bu storyline is quite good.
" Shallow romance
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,5,"I think an audience deserves more depth, especially in the characters Adaline was alright, but Ellis was as creepy and shallow as any bloke I've ever met. In stalker like pursuit of Adaline, her constant turn downs seem to fall on deaf ears as he tries ever harder to woo a lady, whom from the start has shown little or no interest. If you can survive that you have a Harrison ford to creep you out in the second part. Though he is less weird, the film has protracted parts between the two which allows the mind to prepare itself for an intimate scene between a young Blake lively and an older Harrison ford, fortunately this doesn't occur. The concept behind the film is good and theres some nice scenes between the boring creepiness, but it really doesn't save this. My partner apologised for it when the end credits began to roll. -6 for Michiel Huisman inability to understand no mean no, +1 for no CGI helicopters."
" Surprisingly good
",2021-02-24 00:00:00,10,"Surprisingly good.
I must be honest here.
I don't like many American movies.
But, I actually loved this.
Do yourself a favour and watch it."
" So different and purely beautiful
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,10,"I stumbled upon this movie by accidente and couldn't stop watching. And I don't like or wach romantic movies. It takes your heart away, it's not boring or predictable like all other romantic movies. I will watch it again. The filing it gives you is just heartwarming. It's originaly made and verry well performd. I'm in love."
" incredibly executed
",2021-01-22 00:00:00,10,"One of my favourite movies! it was such a put-together, emotional storyline and i loved every bit of it! especially the countless plot twists!"
" Best movie ever
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,10,"This is my all-time favorite movie, it's a movie i can rewatch over and over again."
" Pleasant love story
",2021-01-04 00:00:00,6,"Couldn't fault it really, well crafted and very well acted. If the rating seems low it's just not my genre, the fantasy/sci-fi element appealed, I'm a curmudgeon accordingly.
Oh and there is the elephant in the room moment which no one seemed to mind, yoink!!!"
" Sappy gimmicky love story
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,5,"Telling a well kept intriguing yet fantasy type love story, this film has its moments but is all together too predictable. First, its reasoning as to how she doesn't age is bizarre.Blake Lively giving one of her better performance shines as the lead role. The leading man's character of Ellis comes off as rather creepy, stalker-ish and very much desperate. Perhaps he was miscast? But of course we know how the film will progress and his character does ease up a little in the latter act.The film has a lengthy introduction but does become more engaging once Harrison Ford's character (as Ellis' father) is introduced. A lot of this feels quite coincidental but it does work and we eventually see the reveal of Adaline unfolding.Also had a problem with the narrator. Found it rather irritating and didn't feel it was needed. The voice (sounded a little like Woody Allen) was a turnoff. If they wanted a narrator, perhaps Blake Lively providing the voice herself would have been better.In the end the Age of Adaline is quite different but not as great as many of these reviews seem to get clamoring about. The conclusion is too formidable and predictable but was expected as we knew a typical happy ending would occur. It is simply a sappy predictable love story. But since the ""age twist"" is quite different we can see as to why it is loved."
" Great premise and magical atmosphere mixed with formulaic plot
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,8,"The film has a great premise, some nice moments, but most importantly a magical, sometimes almost mystical atmosphere and beautiful cinematography. Soundtrack is also very good (e.g. the track ""To a Future with an End""). Actors do a good job, especially Blake Lively is stunning.The only drawback is that the plot and (behaviour of) characters are pretty formulaic which drags the emotional/character development plot points a bit down.However, Age of Adaline definitely is one of the better, more unique and more enjoyable romance films."
" Harrison Ford saves the second act...
",2020-12-25 00:00:00,7,Movie starts off interesting and just as it's about to get bogged down: enter Harrison Ford with another great performance.
" Beautiful and touching movie.
",2020-12-18 00:00:00,8,"Seize the time, because life is short, enjoy what life gives you, look for your dreams, don't give up on love, life is made up of moments, don't live life in a hurry. Beautiful reflections for a great movie."
" Like the concept, but some things are weird
",2020-12-04 00:00:00,7,"I like the concept a lot, but everytime Ellis was kissing Adeline it seemed that she did not like him very much. I could not help but think that it was poor acting by Blake Lively, who plays Adeline. It was very distracting, I kept wondering what she did not like about the guy playing Ellis. Was he smelling funny? Didn't he wash is hair? Does she only like actors that are really famous? All those questions popped up. It was also strange that a 107 year old woman would be interested in a guy like Ellis, he felt like a really boyisch man.
I did like Harrison Ford in it a lot. He, and the older woman playing Adelines daughter, brought tears to my eyes at times.
I certainly enjoyed the movie. But some things were just weird and distracting."
" A movie thats worth watching more than twice
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,9,"Outstanding performance from the whole cast... Specially Ford and Lively.The screenplay and the script are the true heros.A movie that's worth watching more than twice. Lots of romance, love & passion."
" Such a beautiful movie
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,10,"There were bits of emotional scenes in the film, and the ending just hit me SO HARD. I ended up crying so much at the end. 100% recommended, 'The Age of Adaline"" is such a beautiful, and elegant film."
" Harrison Ford shines like never before.
",2020-10-19 00:00:00,8,"From Star Wars to Blade Runner, The Fugitive, all the way up to Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, I thought I'd seen all the acting nuances Harrison had, but in this film, The Age of Adaline, a movie totally different than all those films, Ford flexes new acting muscles, and it turns out to be a real winner.The Age of Adaline is about a girl, Blake Lively, who can't grow old. Wouldn't we all like to have this problem. But it's burdensome to her character, Adaline. In flashbacks, we find that Adaline had a relationship with Ford's character, and now she's in a relationship with Ford's son. Ford doesn't turn up until about halfway through the film, and that's when the film shifts into a higher, more heartfelt gear. When Lively, (who is also very good) and Ford look at each other, no matter how fleeting it is, you're sensing that she's reading him, and he's reading her. There scenes together are wonderful to behold, and they both put on a clinic as to how to act without using words.Didn't know Ford had this kind of acting in his repertoire. He also has some very nice scenes with veteran actress, Kathy Bates. i never cry at movies, but i felt the tears being pulled in this film. Which is about as close as I'll ever get to crying.
So, if you're a fan of Ford, then this a must see. If you like heartfelt, romantic films, then it's also a good choice."
" The right mix of romance and sci-fi/fantasy
",2020-10-19 00:00:00,7,"The main premise of this movie is a genre bending mix on a typical love story. The addition of a narrator makes it seem like a grown up version of a fairy tail, and gives it a magical element like the Matilda movie. Blake lively portrays a certain coolness in her character as she carries this movie. The filming locations are gorgeous and add to the magic, especially the setting of the parents home. Despite it being predictable in some regards, it is an enjoyable movie."
" Simple and sweet romance
",2020-10-01 00:00:00,7,"There's nothing all that great or wonderful in The Age of Adaline, but for some reason I emotionally connected with the film. It has an old-fashioned feel to the romance that I kind of miss in an era where Nicholas Sparks has turned the entire genre into a melodramatic mess. There's also a simplicity to this film that I found refreshing. It feels like movies this straightforward and downright wholesome aren't made much any more. I think the biggest mistake they made in The Age of Adaline was feeling the need to explain the magic. Whether it was some focus group, or a studio head, or just an over-zealous writer, the existence of the voice-over in this film was a problem. In movies we can accept magic without needing some ludicrous pseudo-scientific breakdown of the biological process that leads to Adaline not aging.The cast also drew me into The Age of Adaline. Blake Lively continues to prove that she has range as an actress, and I thought this role suited her quite well. She is totally charming and pulls off the wise and experienced personality that would come from living more than a century. Michael Hulsman is not bad, and somehow is likable despite the fact that the script pushes his character ridiculously close to stalker territory. This is also a film I will directly reference in the future when I hear people talk about how Harrison Ford has given up and hardly tries any more. His performance in this movie is emotional, and powerful. I'm not trying to say that The Age of Adaline is a masterpiece or anything like that. However, I found it effective at what it was trying to do, and it hit enough emotional beats to hook me and convince me it might be worth watching again sometime."
" A good film but lacks something
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,7,Personally I feel that Blake's performance is always so sympathetic and appealing and on the point to its character. Blake looks very young and stunning but her speech is all very old and wise. She has all the wisdom and benefits of the age and none of the disadvantages.Aging can depend on the way we look at it. This whole movie depends on it but in all it seemed a very slow moving movie. It could have shown what Adaline could have done with her immortal life. The last part of the movie is very good for a romantic heart and leaves you teary- eyed.
" Amazing fantasy romantic movie..!!
",2020-09-17 00:00:00,7,"A lady got stopped ageing at the age of 29..then she face lot of consequences by law and personally...she crossed many people but a giy fall in love with her deeply and she decided to stay with him permanently...
Really its a interesting story and it would have take as comedy movie also..
She acted well and looks beautiful..
Must watch movie..!!"
" Boring mystery
",2020-09-13 00:00:00,5,I watched this during Quarantine and why did the intro take half the movie? As a film viewer I would have liked to solve the mystery of Adaline myself. and the chemistry between the couple is only so so.
" Beautiful. Good but not great
",2020-08-29 00:00:00,7,"I liked this one, It's good but not great, enjoyed it a lot though. I like time travel stories even though this isn't really time travel but immortality, some of the same timeless rules apply. It follows a beautiful woman who stops aging after a car accident/lightning strike and remains 29 for several decades. When we pick up she is 107 but still looks 29. Except for her daughter (Ellen Burstyn) Adeline refuses to get close to anyone in order to keep her condition a secret and changes her identity and location often but reconsiders her solitary lifestyle after falling in love.I found this to be a unique and interesting story. I liked the ongoing voiceover, Costumes are beautiful and the numerous flashbacks to different eras are well done. Blake Lively does a great job carrying the movie, I especially enjoyed the scenes where she is mothering over her senior citizen daughter. Throughout she maintains an old fashionedness and loneliness about her. The scenes with her dog really got to me. Harrison Ford is not grumpy for a change and pretty cool the actor they got to portray him as a young man, he looks and sounds just like him. This was filmed in Vancouver but you wouldn't know it. My only real negative would be that the love story which was meant to be all consuming lacked intensity or angst which this story seemed to need.This made me think, if you didn't age would you could do with all your time but then also how lonely it would be and sad losing everyone especially all the dogs."
" Very touching and well portrayed love story
",2020-08-11 00:00:00,8,Found the story to be very different and potrayed in an even better manner. Very well acted and one of my favourite romcoms.
" Most beautiful and unreal movie
",2020-07-27 00:00:00,9,"When I watch this film , my mind and the soul stops in every scenes of this movie. I have a wonderful night because of it."
" Just wonderful
",2020-07-27 00:00:00,10,"Beautiful love story , new idea , and beautiful actors, classic, beautiful dresses"
" Go to feel-good movie
",2020-07-14 00:00:00,10,"This movie is beautifully tragic. When you add in love and life lost, it immensely affects your life. Blake Lively creates a sophistication to Adaline Bowman that is unique and intriguing. I completely understand why people fall in love with her. The timeless fashion and impeccable storyline makes this a re watchable film."
" Well worth a watch
",2020-07-07 00:00:00,9,Did not expect this to be so good really enjoyed it like having a great book read to you . Have a watch you will be pleasantly surprised
" A Great Story
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,9,One of my favorite movies for a long long time simply because the story was so believable and unbelievable at the same time. Reminded me a who bunch of Tuck Everlasting. A magic show. I wouldn't want a steady diet of fantasy like this but one every six months or so is just about right. I think I've seen this before because as the story unfolded I kept remembering what was happening and what was going to happen. A great way to spend a quarantine Saturday in Texas..
" Beautiful movie
",2020-06-10 00:00:00,10,"This movie made me cry several times, very touching and beautiful. Loved the storyline, i didn't see many things coming and was hooked from the beginning till the end. I can highly recommend watching this movie if you haven't already, if you're into love story movies."
" Not a new concept, but still enjoyable
",2020-05-18 00:00:00,7,"Imagine taking some elements of Freaky Friday (a freak-occurrence that sends a person experiencing a unique physical change), Groundhog Day (a person being able to live every day to the point of becoming well-versed in many things), Interstellar (a parent who inevitably will outlive their elderly child), and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (young person on the outside, old person on the inside). Add a cute dog and allow the scenery and some landmarks of Vancouver to pose entirely as San Francisco and you have The Age of Adaline."
" Beautiful and Emotional but Predictable
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,7,"The plot was pretty predictable from the beginning, but the movie has been beautifully cast and filmed.
Definitely worth watching."
" Emotional Seesaw
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,8,"Most romantic movies have a realistic theme and plot, but this movie added a little twist to that notion.It was interesting for that reason alone. On top of that, the filmmaking was spectacular. The film crew did a great job piecing together the storyline through flashbacks - as the writers original wrote the fiction story.This is one of the top romantic movies I've ever seen."
" Adored!
",2020-04-23 00:00:00,9,I absolutely adored this movie when it 1st came out! I watched it again tonight with my niece. I love it even more after seeing her love for it too!
" Masterpiece
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,10,"A deep love story. You are getting into the script so heavily that you never think how come a person can not get ages!! Like Benjamin Button , captures your soul from the beginning. The feeling of Harrison Ford is so intense. Blake Lively is a real Hollywood star besides being so pretty. I have ewatched this 4 times and each time I wanna watch again. Not to get older is maybe not a gift, it may be a curse...Who knows?"
" Not so bad but...
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,6,"Whole story is some Disney tale and adaline is blind af
Also I realized you could hit someone's car and then just stand there watching them freeze"
" The Age of Adaline
",2020-03-26 00:00:00,10,"I watched the movie, I like it, it is assumed to write a few words in the likes. It has a very interesting topic. Love film, love film rather fantastic, fantastic, but bring some clarity to the situation with scientific data Adaline hero in the film is ilium
Sir Adaline born in 1908 in 2015. 29 years old. How is it? When you watch the movie carefully, you have to believe in the explanations.
Something magical, Miracle
He is getting married to his island in 1-06-1929. They have a daughter in 1932. In 1937, the architect's husband died in an accident. 10 months later, on his way to the summer house of the Adaline family, next to his 5-year-old daughter, SanFransisco was snowing on the way. The car launches to the lost island of the river. Adaline's body enters the oxygen-free reflex with the effect of ice-cold water. It stops breathing, heartbeat slows. In 2 minutes, the body temperature drops to 30 degrees (normal 36.5). Heartbeat stops. After a while, lightning strikes the vehicle. Half a billion volts of electricity are released and 60 thousand amperes of current are generated. Its effect is three times normal.
First of all, this energy defibrils Adaline's heart. In 2
minutes, he gets rid of the lack of oxygen and breathes in 2 minutes.
The third is the event of the movie.
According to Bhor-Lymon's Electron Compression and DNA principles, in 2035, be careful, with an event known to be discovered in 2035, Adaline's body gains immunity according to the effects of time, remains 29 years old, does not even age for 1 day.
She introduces her 80-year-old daughter to her husband, as her grandmother.
Of course, how to live under the age of 29 with the identity of 107 years later, with the authority and the FBI from time to time, he gets into trouble in traffic, the explanations of exercise, racial, luck, new discovery face can not be believable.
The Chamber is trying to live with fake identities every 10 years by constantly changing jobs and places with travel. Until Taaaaki met Ellis Jones and fell in love. Oddly enough, Ellis' father, the astronomer William Jones (Harrison Ford) Adaline, the man whom Adaline fell in love with 40 years ago and left because of his special situation.
When Ellis takes Adaline to her family's cottage in the forest, she knows Adaline, the creator on her father's arm.
I'm not writing the finale, guess happy and there.
The subject is like this, the main theme is the Bible from the Bible on immortality. As Jesus climbs his cross on the shoulder of the death slope in Jerusalem, he becomes unable to breathe from fatigue.
""My path will be over soon, but you will walk until I return to Earth"" in Jesus. says. This is the starting point of the story.
I like stereotype different from love movies, it is well-done as a cinema.
Acting First-class actor Harrison Ford and Ellen Burstyn are worth seeing the dialogues with her mother, who is at the age of 80, at the age of 80, is not exactly different from a mother / daughter.
Of course, two young lead actors Blake Livel (1987) and Michiel Huisma (1981) should not be forgotten.
Finally, you know who made this beautiful movie? Very shameful if we don't mention it, Lee Toland Krieger (1983) a young 32-year-old boy did wonders, Thank you.
Good for those who are interested.
10/9 -"
" Unique, amazing and beautiful. Perfect ending...
",2020-03-14 00:00:00,10,"One of the most unique and beautiful love stories I've ever seen. My opinions mimic all the other 10 star reviews.Blake Lively is just stunning and perfect in her role, the love and charisma between the character is so charming. Harrison ford is awesome and the back story of him and another character felt veery real to me.I realize that this is not a ""believable"" story line but it simply shines as a romantic drama.If you are a romantic, please do yourself a favor and watch this heartwarning movie.Probably not a date night movie though, as I am not sure men would be as struck with this love story. Grab a bottle wine with your BFF and indulge. Don't forget kleenex. I would not have enjoyed this as much in a movie theatre because I would not have been able to ""ugly cry"""
" ""I can't imagine my life without you.""
",2020-03-02 00:00:00,9,Most people wants to live forever or wants to be young forever. But The Age of Adaline proves that living and staying young forever is nothing when everyone you love is going to die and will get older. I'm so glad Adaline aged again in the end because she's going to have a chance to live normal again.
" Bland when compared to knowing a real centenarian
",2020-02-21 00:00:00,1,"21FEB2020 {1/10 stars F} Recommend? Only if you want a cheesy romance movie. Another lame romance movie that happens to be about a woman who stops aging for many decades.I did not choose to play this movie, but watched anyway. Small parts of the movie are interesting. A lot of the movie is dry, slow and bland. The narrator telling the viewer what is happening on screen was annoying. Movie would have been better if they spent a lot less time developing the chemistry lacking romance and more time on Adaline and her life as a centenarian.Adaline narrating the movie as her centenarian self would have made more sense than some unknown guy that sounds like he is reading a storybook. Weird that Adaline knows several languages, is shown learning Braille, has traveled the world, seen untold changes in society, technology, medicine etc etc and the focus of the movie is a chemistry lacking romance.The alternating time flashbacks made the movie a bit confusing and hard to follow, thinking the flashback is still present time. Ellis' pursuit of Adaline is annoying and stalkerish.This movie makes me think of my great-grandma. She was a centenarian, from The Greatest Generation, that lived to be 102 years old. She did many interesting things during her life that would make a far better movie than this insipid romance plot.CONTENT ADVISORY: Fornication happens twice with actors appearing to be naked in bed together no nudity, fluke that father and son both slept with Adaline 40 years apart, wine and alcohol drinking.{1=F 2=D- 3=D 4=C- 5=C 6=B- 7=B 8=A- 9=A 10=A+}"
" Lovely
",2020-02-21 00:00:00,10,Such a beautiful timeless piece...no pun intended.
" My best for a happening
",2020-02-08 00:00:00,9,"I cam upon this film y accident, but it intrigued me particularly the reasons why Miss Bowman stayed the same. I just continued and I thought it a lovely gentle film with so any problems ... MICHAEL Huisman is very good in the part with his gentle persuasion together with her elderly daughter. It was just a lovely gentle film, classy, a beautiful home in the country with everything and a happy ending - perfect. The grey hair ...tells it all !"
" Blake Lively at her best.
",2020-02-07 00:00:00,7,"I had heard this film was good. I thought it was almost excellent. Blake Lively is at her best of any of her films. Ellen Brynsten is a living legend and raises the quality of any movie she is in. Great supporting cast. The film reminds you of Benjamin Button, but it is unique in it's own plot. Only complaint was that I think it could have been edited to be a bit shorter and also get going a tad faster in the beginning."
" For blokes too!
",2020-01-24 00:00:00,9,"Just watched this, it's a very good movie.I think of it as The HIghlander but in reverse i.e. it's a woman with the 'gift', not a man...Well worth a watch for anyone, but especially anyone with a romantic bent."
" The Age of Adaline
",2020-01-22 00:00:00,9,"Have you ever wondered what life would be like if you stayed the same age forever?
Well Adaline Bowman (Blake Lively) knows what it's like, she is 29 years old and she's been 29 for nearly 8 decades. Adaline was in a car accident during a storm causing her to swerve into a lake and getting hypothermia. The lake was struck by lightning which lead to Adaline not being able to age. ""The Age of Adaline"" is a Drama/ Thriller and is much like the movie ""Safe Haven"" and ""A Simple Favor"". With Adaline not being able to age, she keeps a low profile on herself. She hasn't let anyone take her picture since 1954, every 10 years adaline changes her name packs up and moves to a new place. She still keeps close connection with a friend who happens to be blind, and her daughter Fleming (Ellen Burstyn) who now looks old enough to be Adaline's grandmother.
Blake Lively was the perfect fit to play the role of Adaline. In other movies that Blake is casted in, she is always the one who dresses classy and can be a little mysterious. In the movie ""A Simple Favor"" Blake is not like anyone else in the movie, she doesn't dress like the other actors. Which is much similar to this movie, ""The Age of Adaline"", Adaline's wardrobe doesn't change much in the movie even though it starts in the 50s and ends in 2014. By her dressing like no other person in the movie it makes her stand out from the others. Adaline's clothes isn't the only thing that stands out from the others, her interior design of her house is still decorated as if she's still in the 50s.
One of the most interesting scenes of the film, which happens to also be the most important, is when she got in the accident causing her to not being able to age. In some parts of the movie there is a narrator that you hear who explains how an event happens or the science behind it. This portion of the script was a big element in the storyline of the movie. When Adaline gets in the crash, the whole scene is in slow motion and the narrator is explaining the science behind why she can't age. The scene is also completely silent except for the narrator talking. By having this scene in the movie and having it be shot the way it is, makes the whole movie much more real.
In this aspect of the movie script was a little predictable. Adaline met a man named Ellis Jones (Michiel Huisman) who she falls in love with and as the weeks go by she ends up meeting his parents. Ellis' dad happens to be a man she once fell in love with in the 50s. This event was pretty predictable and at the rate the movie was going, the directors could have had a different scenario on how it played out.
The overall movie was unique and it had a well representation for the life in the 50s and 60s. ""The Age of Adaline"" is for sure a movie that will draw you in and make you ask questions along the way. It brings you to ask yourself, what would life be like if i was in her position? Would I do the same as her and stay in the shadows or would I not run and be the super human that everyone knows about?"
" A Rare 10 of 10
",2020-01-22 00:00:00,10,"I hardly give out 10s. Ingmar Bergmann's 1972 ""Cries and Whispers"", ""Philadelphia"" with Tom Hanks, ""Schindler's List"" and now ""Age of Adaline"".*SPOILER ALERT* The story begins capriciously with Adaline, now Jenny, adopting new identity in San Francisco. The voice over explains her curious past. While this device often detracts, it is done nicely here. Adaline or Jenny seems to glide along in her immortal journey, never ages following an automobile accident and a freak storm. She and her daughter moves from place to place to avoid suspicion.Not laying down long term relationship until Jenny meets intelligent, homesome and persistent charmer, Ellis. She rejects him first but relents as they really enjoy each other's company. The clear, bright San Francisco landscape adds beauty to this already handsome movie. Could this film be made in Chicago with the same results ? Perhaps, but I loved the first choice already. Jenny tries to run away when their relationship begins to sprout. But Jenny relents after slight urging from daughter - maybe she has wanted to further that relationship herself. A short time later Ellis asks Jenny to join him for a weekend celebration at his parent's 40th anniverary. The story line has been light and breezy to this point just like the lead character Adaline/Jenny, played engagingly by Blake Lively. It all changed when Ellis brought Jenny to meet his parents, suddenly, the plot leaps into high gear, from light romance to serious drama and asks many life's most ironic questions. William, Ellis's father, were stunned to see Adaline as the girl he almost proposed to before she ran out on him, 40 yr ago. ""Adaline Bowman was my mother"", Jenny quickly improvised. As William, Harrison Ford displayed he can play serious role beside action figures. Confounded and puzzled, William reminesces his romance with Adaline before he met his current wife. He makes use of his encounters with Jenny to find out more about Adaline. Then by chance he noticed the scar on Jenny's wrist. Startled, he rushed to find an old photograph of Adaline with bandage on the same hand, which had received a flesh wound from a bare branch when they were hiking through the woods. William confronts Jenny privately and she finally admits who she is. William begs her to not run away, for the sake of Ellis. But she does, bringing the movie to its climax.The most effective scenes are Jenny with William - when William was quizzing her and when they finally re-unites as former lovers. As Adaline, Blake Lively totes elegance ,beauty and poignancy when calls for. Ford was effective even unforgettable in his role as someone who must reckons with love lost and love found but under most unusual and ackward circumstance. Nice to see Ellen Burstein acting again, this time as the daughter who has aged. The scenes between mother and daughter were cogent even though on screen Burstein should be the mother, but deft acting by both of them shows the daughter still leaning on the mother, and the mother though looks younger, retains presence as a mother would. Fuzzy haired Ellis, played by Michael Huisman, rounds out the talented cast. Kathy Baker has brief screen time as Ellis's mother."
" Heartwarming
",2020-01-05 00:00:00,8,"Other than the mumbo jumbo science explanations and the cliche ""heart brought back from dead"" parts this movie was very heartwarming. I also loved the comet analogy at the end of the movie that was a nice parallel to the movie. Although I also find it strange the guy would just accept that she's 108 years old so quick and the fact his dad loved her so passionately and he seems ok with it is weird but other than that no complaints."
" Amazing Acting! Beautiful movie.
",2019-12-20 00:00:00,10,"This is such a beautifully written movie, it's classy and subtle. And Blake L. plays her role so eloquently and perfectly, it's like the wrote the role just for her! She really shows her maturity as a woman and actor in this movie."
" Worth watching
",2019-09-13 00:00:00,7,"While I found Adaline's predicament in the first half of the movie very moving, once things started heading toward the resolution in the second half, I found myself less engaged. There were still many tearful moments--I thought Harrison Ford, whose characters often come off as cold and distant to me, was particularly effective this time around--but the contrived nature of the meeting between Lively and Ford, as well as the just-as-expected ending which could be seen coming a mile away, took a lot of the emotional wind out of the film's sails. I especially think the confusion and uncomfortable weirdness introduced by the dual, father vs. son love interest worked against the film rather than in its favor, as the viewer feels sympathy for both men and is never given any real reason to favor one over the other. Ford's declaration of love for his current wife at the end represented not a resolution of this dramatic conflict, but a mere sidestepping of the issue, which was his obvious, lingering feelings for Adaline.Another reviewer said that Blake Lively showed a great deal of range in this movie, but I disagree. She had her emotionally-paralyzed, straight-faced stoic routine down pat, which was a great strength of the first half or more of the movie, but then that persisted on even to the very end, after she had supposedly been freed from her lonely, loveless prison. It may not have been her fault, as any scenes in which we might have seen her smile and act affectionate were too few and too short anyway, but when the brief tears she shed for her dying dog represented the very apex of her emotional expression in the film I find it hard to agree with that other reviewer's assessment. Having said that, I do think she did a great job up until the end in communicating the terrible difficulty and pain one would likely feel in having to deal with her situation. Put succinctly, her performance was good, it just wasn't particularly broad.I also liked the actor who played Ellis (sorry, his name is escaping me right now) a great deal. I thought he was a pretty boy who wasn't a typical pretty boy. He came across to me as a believable human being and a decent guy. That's a surprisingly rare thing in today's movies. I hope to see more of him, as he doesn't make me want to throw popcorn at the screen every time he shows up there like so many other young actors today do."

" Han Solo!
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,4,The guy who played the younger version of the Harrison Ford character does a perfect impression of Ford. Was he even considered for Solo A Star Wars Story? HE should have got the part instead of the dreadful actor who did and turned that film into a huge flop
" Original, well shot, well acted, gripping, touching and intelligent. A rom-com with brains.
",2019-08-07 00:00:00,8,"Adaline Bowman (Blake Lively) is suspended at the age of 29 following a freak accident.
When it becomes clear that she cannot live safely with her secret, she resigns herself to moving countries and changing identities every ten years to protect herself and her daughter.Adaline lives through world wars, London's swinging sixties scene and now, present day San Francisco, all the while keeping herself from getting too close to anyone for fear of hurting them when she finally has to move on, and hurting herself with the knowledge they can never grow old together.The scenes between Adaline and her ageing daughter are sweet and heartwarming, serving to reveal the deep connections between family that transcend age and geography.Similarly, the love story between Adaline and our leading man (whose on-screen father, Harrison Ford provides the major spanner in the works) is also heightened with the knowledge that our heroine has truly been waiting a lifetime (many, in fact) to meet the one person she can finally reveal her true self to.Lively embodies an old, patient, wise soul beneath her surface beauty and her emotional resistance due to decades of pain in deceiving those she loves is heartbreaking to watch.The Age of Adaline is the sort of film that is sadly a rarity these days - original, well shot, well acted, gripping, touching and intelligent. A rom-com with brains."
" Sheer beauty
",2019-07-21 00:00:00,10,"This is as beautiful as it can get....be it narration or screenplay or the acting , everything about this movie is so good...makes the viewer feel good while at the same time let him experience the whole gamut of emotions...specially with Ford's character arc. the direction is done in such a beautiful way that viewer can empathize with the characters and the story as if they themselves are a part of the story. Blake Lively as always impressed with her acting and was supported by all the wonderful cast.
A visual treat for anyone who watches this. 10/10 would recommend it to others to watch"

In a span of 10 - 12 years and around 20 movies to boot till date, she has carved a niche for herself with her par excellence emotive skills and a higher class of acting that elevates a caper notches high in quality even when at times when the movie is bordering on tolerable absurdity, oscillating in the borderline. Right from Sisterhood of Travelling Pants, Green Lantern, Savages, Shallows, All I see is You & Simple Favour, she has grown in level of finesse, delivering almost virtuoso performances with an endearing, graceful poise. She has also delivered memorable performances on the Tube in that runaway hit soap Gossip Girl & hosted few Saturday Night Live shows displaying perfect funny bones and in the moment presence.The caper which am now talking about, The Age of Adaline is no different either which am still surprised as to how I had missed it till date! Anyway, I made amends at last and happy that I did. Better late than never. Blake plays the role of Adaline, a 1908 born woman who stops ageing at the age of 29 after coming alive after being clinically dead, out of a sunken car which she hurtles down the river below Golden Gate Bridge in a freak accident in 1937. That is a RARE affliction she is suffering from now, which many men and women give their right arm to get 😃The movie actually opens when Blake goes into a fake records maker to get her new set of driving license, Passport & Social Security and starts unfolding Blake's spell binding presence on us from that point onwards. During her lifetime she gets married, delivers a daughter then loses her husband in an accident. All this is shown with some kind of commentary of sorts in the background while life goes whirring past. That narration is some what the only below par point of an otherwise engrossing and taut movie which it turns into in the second half. There is a full-blown explanation on how things happened and how things changed for her and the scientific reasons behind it, made in an effort to make it realistic actually does the opposite to the movie. Minus that the movie is Brilliant.The camera work is brilliant without a doubt. First 4o minutes of movie is some what slow which is building the story up and putting all the bricks in the wall to make it complete before it starts gathering pace and picks up pace and nicely chugs along. Adaline finally leave daughter behind in the race since she is ageing and Adaline is not and gets into tricky situations when her acquaintances start noticing it. She makes an appearance later when her daughter is considerably aged and daughter starts introducing her mother as her friend since the mother is still 29 and daughter is nearing 50! There are some poignant moments like these where Blake starts upping the ante and shows her class in acting department, showing that confusion, avoiding love/relationships, suffering loneliness and despair in a pretty supple yet sublime fashion that only she is capable of! In one of her meetings with her daughter to celebrate new year almost near the end of first half is when the Hero, dashing Michiel Huisman of Black book, 2:22, Irreplaceable You etc, makes the entry.They both have a very good understanding and terrific on-screen chemistry that's pretty riveting. Harrison Ford also puts in a very measured and endearing supporting role as Michiel Huisman's dad and there is a mystery angle which brings the movie on its head in a pretty engrossing manner when Harrison enters the frame. Overall the movie makes an honest effort and succeeds in weaving a sweet connect between a romantic past and embracing the love & happiness of the present.

" Enjoyable. But oh, so Hollywood.
",2019-06-27 00:00:00,7,"I enjoyed this movie and most everyone will., as most have said here. It always amuses me and is so predictable that whenever Hollywood writers want you to like their characters they are A. Beautiful. B. Rich and politically correctly so.
Call me a cynic, but of course Blake Lively falls in love with a guy who is rich, but his wealth comes from an invention of a ""climate prediction"" model. But it is his roommate who uses it for economic success. Hollywood would never allow him to get his hands dirty pursuing wealth. Not him! And of course he is on the boards of so many organizations going GOOD. And he can cook. And he is rebuilding his apartment. What a guy!! AND the perfect beard, too. Blake Lively is beautiful and brilliant beyond anything realistic. Her personality is so perfect in that she knows precisely the right comment for every occasion. I kept saying to myself ""give me a break."" Does she have NO flaws? Apparently not. I know this is a fantasy, but c'mon. Harrison Ford has the best character. And does the best work in the movie. Now there's a problem to have!. Maybe his is the most believable character because he shows some flaws as any human has. I won't spoil it, but his problem could have been the whole movie. Gotta love Hollywood's gobbledygook language by the voiceover about how her problem began and ends. Science at the hands of Hollywood is always a good joke. Lastly how sad is it to see how beautiful S.F used to be before its political correctness took over. All in all a touching, imaginative, flawed movie that you will enjoy, just leave every expectation of believable characters at the door before you enter."

" What were they thinking?
",2019-06-13 00:00:00,1,"Temporal loops are notoriously difficult to handle in sci-fi, how much more so in what tries to be a movie in the romance genre. You can't make romance out of people going to their eternal rest around you while you stand tall like a Sequoia sapling that's got eons to live. The premise of the plot is just ludicrous, the ""science"" behind Adaline's accident is laughable and the rest of the plot is less convincing than the saying in a Chinese fortune cookie.
Blake Lively is a luminous screen presence, completely underestimated by casting directors so far. She is completely wasted in this nonsense, even though she acquits herself honourably. I'm waiting to see her in something worth her talents. And the other character actors get sucked into the grind and become indistinguishable from the props."
" LOVE it
",2019-06-12 00:00:00,10,"I absolutely love this movie! I can watch it over and over again. I love the passion, the science, and the love. 😍😍😍"
" Enjoyable and a Unique Idea
",2019-06-06 00:00:00,8,I won't say that it's a masterpiece or a must watch but it's certainly aa fine romantic movie with a unique idea. Enjoyed every single moment of it and hope it will worth your time.
" Could've been better
",2019-06-02 00:00:00,8,"A beautiful movie with beautiful acting. This truly brings out the emotions in you. Only reason why I'm not rating it a ten, is the disappointing ending. Adaline being brought back to life, and aging again was unrealistic and rushed. If she had died, it would be heartbreaking, but more fitting for the movie. The ending was unnessecarily happy, ruining the movie's overall melancholy concept."
" Wow i watched 4 times

" Coincidental, at best.
",2019-05-19 00:00:00,7,"Aside from the fact that the trailer essentially ruined the entire movie, this film relies heavily on astronomical coincidences to drive its plot forward. Sure, there were elements of it that were handled well (like the way she spoke and the period pieces), but so much of it was cliche that it was hard to take seriously."
" Incredible movie!
",2019-05-09 00:00:00,10,"Incredible movie! Congratulations to scriptwriters, actors and the whole team became involved in the creation of this film. An incredible story that makes you think ... if it happens to you ...! :)"
" Potentially interesting material smothered in sentimentality
",2019-03-30 00:00:00,6,"This film firmly establishes one thing - Blake Lively (stupid name) is one fine looking woman. The camera lingers gratefully on her multiple beauties, elegant silhouette, long delicate fingers, tumbling hair.. it's something to be grateful for as the film which starts well gradually runs out of steam. It's an interesting scenario, the woman who cannot age and the ramifications this has for her life and relationships. Her longish face has an European elegance (sort of a Gillian Anderson look), and it is established that she is sinking into melancholy and is cut off, by her own resolution, from forming new relationships. The melancholy mood, once evoked, is reinforced by the monotonal music. Little useful capital is made of opportunities to fill in with material from her past that would be of interest. The film focusses on the heroine's romance with Ellis and how it leads to her identity being uncovered. Ellis is played by a poor man's (woman's) Ashton Kutcher, whose character certainly doesn't appeal to me, he's a sort of a dog-like, handbag-type man. This part of the film is painfully slow and wallowing in sentiment. I never recovered much interest in the second half of the movie and watched the end with indifference. Overall, I am OK with the slightly hokey scenario and denouement, it has some interest and originality, and it's just a pity that the whole thing was turned into a tearjerker."
" A beautiful fantasy
",2019-03-27 00:00:00,8,"A beautiful fantasy. Great capture of a premise we've seen before. Great casting, well performed. Blake Lively and Michiel Huisman - for many that is enough of a draw, but add Ellen Burstyn, Kathy Baker and, even, Harrison Ford (I'm not usually a fan of his) and the expectations increase. Filmed in beautiful British Columbia, the locations just add an etherial quality. My only criticism of this film is the unnecesary use of narration. It's a fantastic premise that doesn't need to be turned into a scientific treatise in order for us to suspend belief. I give this film an 8 (great) out of 10. Worthy of rewatches. {Fantasy Romance}"
" The Eternity of Boredom
",2019-03-22 00:00:00,1,"The Age of Adaline should be renamed the Eternity of Boredom. It had good potential. I certainly wasn't expecting a master piece but at least something watchable. Blake Lively's inspiration for her character must have been dishwater as she was tepid and one dimensional throughout. At first her shyness was endearing then it became boring until it became bordering on irritating. She's supposedly lived longer than anyone else coupled with the incredible heartbreak of leaving her lover behind yet it doesn't really show unless you count the two tear drops that she shed. (Psychopath?) The main male was too unbelievable to be a real person. He somehow created one math equation and through that he garnered enough money to live like a Saudi prince without a single care in the world except for the uncomfortableness of the familiarity his dad feels for his girlfriend. The film felt like a thriller film whereby the main lead takes drastic pursuits, like following her, figuring out where she works and awkwardly trying to donate royally expensive comic books to Adaline's workplace at which Adaline barely bats an eye. I guess once you've lived 100 years nothing impresses you anymore. In the real world this behaviour is called stalking and may even result in a restraining order but for whatever reason we are supposed to believe it is true romance. His stalker-like pursuit for Adeline, despite the fact he is a multimillionaire and presumably has other options, coupled with her total lack of interest towards him makes it awkward to watch. They feel like awkward friends at best not impassioned lovers . Great romances make you want to believe but this one kept me doubting. It was absurd in lieu of magical. Both the main leads were unbelievable. I stopped watching little more than halfway through before Harrison Ford could salvage what little left there was of the movie to save. So little apparently I decided it best to just hit stop."
" One of the better romances
",2019-03-15 00:00:00,8,"I'm shallow. I think Adaline looks beautiful, and that affects my perception . But her acting is very convincing too, in the sense that she behaves in the well considered way that someone with much life experience does. But I agree with another reviewer, that as a person with more wisdom, she would probably be slower to fall for someone, and for deeper reasons. I also agree with yet another reviewer complaining that Ellis is too plastic a character, but less so than the typical male character in romances. I see him as a prop for propelling the plot. There's one obvious eye candy scene where you see his muscles, and wonder why he has not been seen going to the gym or even remotely worrying about such things. The story line was good, the moment of truth was convincing. I like the way they didn't try to justify the science of it, pretty well saying to the audience not to worry about ""how"" and just roll with the situation that it sets up. Toward the end, it was very predictable, including to final the incident. I kept on thinking that if they actually made what I think was going to happen, it would be very disappointing, just because it was so obvious. But it didn't end up too badly. Overall, one of the better romances."
" How could anyone not love this?
",2019-03-15 00:00:00,10,"Don't listen to those negative reviews. They are from superficial people who don't find meaning in anything. This movie is for those of us who ponder about life, death, love, and heartbreak. Get your box of tissues ready."
" 50% Narration
",2019-03-12 00:00:00,2,"There was too much narration in place of clever screenwriting and cinematography to execute this story. There is so much that the idea of ""film"" can deliver, yet they chose to have most of it just explained to us by some guy. I also noticed a lack of character development for all characters including the lead, as there are very little distinctive personalities to them. The love story lacked chemistry in my opinion, very little emotion and very scripted, and moved much too quickly. Huge problem considering the fact that this is supposed to be a love story.I see how you can enjoy this casually as a background to washing dishes or something, but it most definitely is not a piece of art."

That's not a spoiler, as it is made known in the trailer as well as at the very beginning of the film.It sounds original in a way, though we've seen things like it before. But it follows the exact same predictable formula as so many other boring movies. It's not interesting and I could not wait for it to end. Fortunately the acting is at least pretty good, and there was some interesting narration that set this film apart from all the others and made it memorable in my mind, so those things kept it from being a total disaster. It's still not worth watching, however. Do not recommend."

" Great premise and a equally great implementation
",2019-02-07 00:00:00,9,"Adaline, a woman who lost her ""ability"" to age after a car accident, is always on the run. Always changing her identity and her residence, her life seems more like a struggle, especially as love seems to be out of the question due to her unique condition. But, things are about to change as she meets a charming man on a new years eve who seems determined to keep her company, no matter the odds.It's a movie with a very interesting premise which has an unique way of presenting its story. It has a great narrator which does a great job of summarizing when needed while letting the characters explain the details. The movie's plot is complex, hard to predict and enjoyable. It manages to maintain interest while also being credible and plausible. Its characters are also very well thought and put into picture, being able to transmit plenty of emotion with everything they do.The action happens at a pretty slow pace, but it isn't something that one would mind. The unique way in which it depicts drama, romance and emotion doesn't let you get bored at any time. Add a great plot into the equation, one which brings back memories and generates suspense, and you get one truly great experience.In terms of visuals, the movie doesn't excel, but it keeps a high bar all the time, with great camera angles and even some interesting special effects.As a conclusion, I saw a great movie which features a good plot, very good characters and also actors. It created such a wonderful atmosphere which was able to transmit plenty of emotion and drama, while ending in style."
" Love is truly Timeless...
",2019-01-09 00:00:00,7,"Adeline (Blake Lively) is a young, beautiful woman who becomes ageless after she is involved in an accident. After many years of living forever young and not ageing a single day, Adeline meets a new man who will challenge her to question the eternal life she has become comfortable living. After all, she cannot age and therefore she cannot die. While she is watching life continue to slowly die around her, will her past ever catch up with her?Now before I go further, I purchased this movie as a blind buy. I knew very little about the plot and film prior to watching this on Bluray. In fact, I've never even seen a trailer for it. I asked myself 'did the film even go to cinemas???' Surely it did???The 1st thing that took my breath away while watching the film is the incredible audio track. The film pays such a great amount of detail to the audio track from the film's opening scene to the ambient noise surrounding our leads; even just the gentle soundtrack as snow falls on the road. The visuals here are just as good, perhaps even better! Both elements are something to speak highly about. Many shots are very creative and captivating. I found myself glued to the film from the start, just based on the quality and details alone.I also personally enjoyed some the acting in this film. Adeline, played by Brake Livley, brings such a gentleness and innocence on screen. Adeline is a character who has been on the run, living in sadness and fear, feeling alone. Even her very own daughter is getting older and dealing with old age. The second mention is the surprising performance by Harrison Ford. Without spoiling the film, I will say that Harrison Ford's performance gave me a new and improved take on the actor. His character alone could almost steal the whole film and he managed to bring such emotion to the scenes.In regards to plot, I started watching the film with the intention that I would just watch a little bit and go to bed. I'm shocked to say that the film sucked me right in until the end credits. I'm not a big sucker for drama or romantic films, but this film just felt so new and fresh with its stunning performances. The film also managed to sneak in some mysteries.As for disappointments, some of the dialogue between Adeline's new possible love interest can come close to corny, which is a shame because the script otherwise was enjoyable. Also, a narrator telling us information can feel forced, or perhaps the director felt we couldn't figure the story out on our own... Without spoilers, I can say the film's ending can be questionable, but hey, it's just a movie people 🤓Overall, this is a film that surprised me and sucked me into a genre I don't usually go for. Due to Blake Lively and Harrison Ford's excellent performances, this is a film that is suitable for any guy or girl to watch. Give it a go- you might be surprised, just like myself.7.2/10

" An Immortal Woman That Cannot Drive lol
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,6,"AS the main page synopsis says, this tale is about a woman born at the turn of the 20th century that is ""gifted ( or cursed) with youthful immortality. Yet this does not mean she cannot die of injury, or harm or attempts upon her life, as far as we know. The director was not deep enough to even broach such matters.
Yet for all her many years of life, gaining knowledge and some experiences here and there...the main character sucked at driving. What the...?
I am not sure why the story focuses so much upon this gals lack of skill behind the wheel, regardless of the era, but its plain to see. In the film this lady not only gains her ""immortality"" from a car accident, but throughout the film she cant figure out why a car stalls, breaks dow, how to properly maintain cars, even in a hidden theater that used to be a drive in, with vintage automobiles that would still fetch a high price to collectors. Continuing on her journey of endless obscurity, this lady takes cabs everywhere because I suppose she cannot always have a valid drivers license that identifies her as an ageless person, Plus she seems fairly terrible at driving. Then when she finally gets back behind the wheel, her lack of sense and skill driving or any amount ofstudy or practice at driving is shown when she drives a SAAB. She is so reckless that she tears across the Golden gate Bridge in a fashion that would get anyone put in jail, let alone ticketed. And by the end ofthe film, Adeline crashes, AGAIN, simply from not checking in her side and rear view mirrors.
Now this was a nice enough movie about the turmoil of actually having longevity, which so many have longed and searched for since time immemorial, and the troubles of it falling upon a lonely woman. BUt where was the full meat of her travels? WHy had she not tried to enlist in wars or aid as a nurse or anything interesting? She missed out on chances to travel much further than just merry old england, so the story missed opportunities to explore her life as a wanderer throughout recent history. Adeline simply chose to always be within a state or two of her daughter in California. This ageless woman saved virtually no money aside from an old Xerox stock account, and having no mention of grandchildren through her one sole offspring managed to aid a daughter that aged normally, whilst Adeline stayed virtually on the lamb, snagging legit jobs with fake identities and managing to always afford rent within the california bay area when she would move back.
The writers chose to make this story a bit shallow, but it is a romance, so... *sighs * I suppose one gets what one pays for.
I cant help but feel like the writer didnt fully understand that they were painting this woman ( or all women by extension) as poor or mediocre drivers. Kinda bizarre that this was so prevalent.
A nice enough film for romance seekers, just dont expect to have any more meat or depth to it than a somewhat decent bookstore romance novel. 6/10"
" A gem if there ever was
",2018-11-15 00:00:00,9,"The Age of Adaline will pull at the heart of anyone lucky enough to have it grace any screen they have, either phone or television this movie has a brilliant way of showing emotion in a new light no matter the device you use.Now, if you'll excuse me, I must go find the tissue box-J"
" A beautiful love story
",2018-11-03 00:00:00,10,"The age of Adaline is a great love story movie, never get old from watching it. Also, Blake Lively and Michiel Huisman have great chemistry together, love their performances. Very touching, loving, emotional, fun, très romantic. Absolute movie to rewatch from time to time."
" A movie that binds you till the end with utmost curiosity
",2018-10-09 00:00:00,8,"When i had heard the plot, I expected it to be somewhat vampire-ish. But to my surprise and delight, it turned out to be a great movie, a non-cliched one. Blake Lively did her part amazingly well. She had all the seriousness and know-all attitude that's needed to be there in a lady who has lived for 107 years. Some more minutes of the movie dedicated to her struggle to exist after the change to no more change would've been good to watch.I just have two things that were weird in the movie-
1- Why did Adaline had so many locks on her door after all these years of running and never been caught?
2- Why did Adaline never take her dog out? A dog who isn't capable of spilling her secret to anybody?I am not quite sure how all the science stuff fits in and how far that is true. But they have showed a good connection and explanation of everything that has happened. It's a movie that will bind you to curiously watch it till the end. It has good costumes, eye catching backdrop, love story (both father's and son's) amazing mother-daughter relationship and a very peculiar storyline. Loved every minute of it."
" Best of my best
",2018-09-16 00:00:00,10,"I'm 40 years old and I've seen many a film. This was the film to top my list. It was an extremely moving and poignant film. What a great story, filmed m, acted and directed to perfection."
" Pretty relevant romance
",2018-09-09 00:00:00,7,"First of all, i'm gonna talk about my experience with the film:
I was looking for a romance/drama and found this film. I didn't know what the movie was about until i started to see and it didn't surprise me, but it wasn't monotonous.
The main thing i can talk about without spoiling it, was the ""surprises"" that the movie has. When you think you already know how it's going to end, then comes another fact, changing the direction where it was going to.
There are some pretty relevant scenes when it comes to the relationship between adaline and the boyfriend. I say relevant because these scenes would easily be fool if it wasn't for a good script and directing. 
The plot reminded me about Benjamin Franklin a little.
I think that there are some characters that could've been better explored, like Amanda Crew. She appears only a few times but she's funny and i think she could participate more.
And Adaline and Ellis are amazing here, there are so much connection between them and it convinces us pretty much, that's why i said about relevance. It's pretty pleasant to see them together, and it all makes it a pretty good movie.
I can't talk about it anymore without including spoilers, so it was a good movie for the gender, not that spectaculous, but well directed, and pretty relevant. I was entertained and satisfied. 
Would give it a 7.6"
" A different type of romance

" loved it
",2018-07-31 00:00:00,10,This movie was amazing and I enjoyed every aspect of it. it was on my watchlist for a while and I finally got around to watching it and it was incredible
" Truly moving love story
",2018-07-16 00:00:00,10,Blake Lively fulfills a blissful character to whom's life swiftly becomes almost unbelievable. A beautiful approach to a love story indeed. This film also enlightens the viewer with an insight to many historical backgrounds.
" A lovely romance story
",2018-06-16 00:00:00,8,"Main characters are attractive, special effect and music background are good, gentle and soft. They make the film quite interesting.
The plot is not impressive but they clearly explain why she isn't affected by time, not keeping the cause a secret. That's what differentiates the movie from most of the film about immortals. +1 point for the film.
If you like romance movies, you should watch it."
" A very enjoyable film.
",2018-06-13 00:00:00,8,It was a very enjoyable film to watch. I did not expect it to be that good. Interesting story and good performances.
" great movie, not so great ending
",2018-06-06 00:00:00,8,"Beautiful execution, loved the plot and the way it was told in the film... just didn't feel worth it once the ending sets in. really subpar in comparison to the other parts of the movie. ending took the movie down by a ton of notches. i mean it's great that she gets older but the way she got older again was just kind of lazy... feels as if they were pushed for time to just end the film"
" Simple plot yet powerful message
",2018-05-01 00:00:00,9,"We spend our lives scared of dying and growing old but in fact we find out at some point that fear of death pushes us forward. 
It's a wonderfully written story. Although I am not a fan of fantasy elements but since it shares a great point I enjoyed every single moment of the movie. I began watching it a year ago and I stopped it after 10 or 15 minutes since I just didn't find it interesting. However today it was intriguing and not at all boring which just proves me once again that we have to be in a certain state of mind to enjoy some movies. It reminded me a bit of Benjamin Buttons although it bears no similarity in the plot just the idea - different aging process or lack of it for that matter."
" NOTHING MAKES SENSE WITHOUT HER
",2018-04-30 00:00:00,7,"This is a romance. Adaline Bowman (Blake Lively) was born Jan1, 1908. Through a freak accident involving cold water and lightning (Thank you Mary Shelly) beautiful Adaline has stopped aging, something only known to her aged daughter (Ellen Burstyn). She becomes well off with her Xerox investment and extremely cultured. She is pursued by the handsome, rich, cultured Ellis Jones (Michiel Huisman). This leads us to a number of problems.I have seen this before, except it was with a vampire. The film was well done, but not over powering. Adaline lives a quiet life as a librarian. There isn't much excitement in her flashbacks. I can see where this would appeal to a woman's fantasy.No f-bombs or nudity. Implied sex"
" Just me perhaps - but the fantasy dimension didn't work
",2018-03-04 00:00:00,4,"This time I haven't scrolled through the Reviews, except to notice that the first few gave high rankings.
I have to admit I found this Netflix film only from my wish to see Michiel Huisman again after my first experience of him in The Otterman Lieutenant - as a lover of romanticism (and of Turkey) who can suspend political-historical factism for the sake of a moving story. I realise The Age of Adaline gave much evidence of high quality filmic skills, but the plot/story was not for me. Ellis is a lovely man, and apart from the unlikely coincidences, the meeting and pursuing of Adaline (Jenny) was effective enough. That's about it.I have no idea if the nerdy voice-over has any veracity or not, but it didn't convince me and I am never a target for fantasy-science fiction - even less so if it's dressed up as romance/love. (Maybe ET was an exception way back!)
So sadly I have to give a low score. The logic from me is that I wouldn't recommend it to friends. Despite the fine acting, the sheer fantasy of it all didn't jell for me apart from a sort of satisfaction that it ended suitably."
" Over complicated but charming comedy
",2018-03-01 00:00:00,6,"An easy going and at times predictable romantic movie perfectly suited to a snowy Sunday afternoon. It has a truely fantastical and I think unnecessary plot line, but this aside it is engaging and well acted."
" The Age of Adaline is a bittersweet tale that depicts a beautiful curse.
",2018-02-25 00:00:00,7,"The ability to never age. Yes, a young woman named Adaline dies in a freak accident. Yet, unexplainable (in any logical sense), she is brought back to life and is now unable to age. Youth, it is something we cling on to. The uncontrollable desire to never grow old. Closer and closer to death. Yet, is this a blessing or a curse? Seeing everyone else that you love go through life til their timely deaths. This film beautifully explores that idea. Initially, I wasn't too sure if this was going to a sappy romance, fortunately it wasn't. In fact, this was executed with extreme class and elegance. Most of this is provided by the central character, performed eloquently by Blake Lively. She made Adaline elusive, incorporating many fine details that made her utterly watchable. Lively's sheer natural beauty (my God...what a babe), the vintage fashionable attire and the way she executes the lines with such class. She needs more lead roles. Ellen Burstyn was fantastic, but wanted more screen time of her. This is Harrison Ford's best performance in quite some time, it actually seems like he wants to be there. An understated emotional role that felt very nuanced. The main love interest and relationship itself was sweet, nothing too powerful or emotionally investing. The direction was surprisingly better than average, I mean some of the shots were magnificent to watch, especially the thunderbolt hitting Adaline's car. I do love me some good slow motion. The countless scenes of narration explaining the apparent ""science"" behind the freak accident and illustrating Adaline's past life felt uninspired and lazy. I also found the ending to be slightly tame, in comparison to the more powerful first two acts. However, in saying that, this caught me by surprise. I found it to be a sweet and endearing romance with a good sci-fi twist. Highly enjoyable, would happily watch again."
" One of the best movies I've seen in quite a while
",2018-02-22 00:00:00,9,"My wife and I both thoroughly enjoyed this. We picked it up at Redbox one evening. The movie kept us glued to the TV until we finished it. Blake Lively is extraordinarily charming and complex in this. Harrison Ford gives one of his typically stellar performances and adds a lot of weight just where it's needed.I noticed quite a few things in terms of the script and plot that were well thought out (metaphors, etc.).This is a deep but enjoyable film that left me wanting more."

" Not a Romance
",2018-01-05 00:00:00,3,"I had to stop watching because the ""romance"" was so offensive and unrealistic. A man finds our leading lady alone at a party and cracks a terrible joke, the type that only works for handsome leading men, and only in movies. She engages in a brief conversation, but gives him zero indication of interest and soon extricates herself from the situation. Later, after she steps into an elevator, a large hand stops the elevator door from shutting. It is our leading man, of course, and he gets on, and makes a crack about how that'll teach him for putting his hand where it doesn't belong. Ew. She's trapped on an elevator with a man who just made an icky sex joke. She continues to show zero interest. He follows her to her cab, and AGAIN puts his hand somewhere it doesn't belong, this time grabbing the open window to stop the cab and try again to get her phone number. She doesn't give it to him.But lo and behold, he shows up at her job. He's going to donate some valuable books, but not if she won't give him her phone number. WHAAT?? So finally she acquiesces and he takes her on a date. Guess where? To an underground tunnel. This is the point when I turned it off. Because what woman in her right mind would go alone with a man she barely knew, who has been nothing but sexually aggressive AND controlling, into a dark tunnel with no one around? And are we the viewers really supposed to find this romantic?No wonder why so many men appear to be so confused about sexual harassment. Here is a movie where a man sexually harasses a woman who shows no sign of interest, but oops! She was just playing hard to get! Men, this is not how it works in real life. For the record, if you have just met a woman and would like to get to know her, and she has shown no sexual interest in you, probably it is not a good idea to make a joke about putting your hand where it doesn't belong. And all those things that came after that? DON'T DO THOSE THINGS. What a turnoff."
" Nice and new story.
",2018-01-05 00:00:00,6,"The movie's idea is nice andvery new to me. There are many parts that I liked very much, but there are also many other parts whom were very boring! There was also some parts that were very exaggerated to be used which don't suit the story's events at all."
" In a trashy market, a very refreshing and enchanting love story!
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,8,"At the beginning, this story may seem to be another cheesy and repeated love story; however, the actor's non-overplayed roles draw you in the story, making this two-hour film go by really fast. Whoever wrote this did it very well since the story does not fall into nonsense romantic drama and endless love stories. It keeps a fascinating tension throughout it that makes it at times pleasing to watch.You may wonder why I'm rating this with 8 instead of 10, and the reason is that there is no perfect movie, and this one has some timeline flaws, specifically, Adelaine's timeline is not clear though."
" cringe/10
",2017-12-16 00:00:00,3,"A great idea for a movie that is kind of ruined by the corny, cliché lines that just make you cringe. I was first drawn to this movie as i thought the story line looked unique and i jump at the opportunity to watch a movie that i haven't seen 100 times before. However, there were a lot of times where the execution of this story was overshadowed by feelings of utter cringe at the two love birds awfully written flirting one liners and smart remarks. The writer was trying to make the characters appear as witty as possible but it just made the romance unrelatable and robotic."
" No movie magic
",2017-11-26 00:00:00,4,"At first the movie seems interesting but that's where it stops. The movie never really took off. They had PLENTY of opportunities to have that magic movie moment that makes the film memorable. However, they never took it. Then the ""plot twist"" you saw coming from a mile away. But, I will say (hopefully not giving away any spoiler) I did admire they way they wrapped one part of the film like bow. Would I recommend this film ..... no."
" Beautiful and lovely movie
",2017-11-24 00:00:00,6,"First of all, this movie was very beautiful in some point, Story, appearance, and so on. Although I got a little confusing about the aspect of SF, but totally I was very content w/ love. As I mentioned above, it has both aspects of SF and romantic, but mainly it is a roman movie. Heroine's emotion was seemed to come out through the screen."
" Visually Pretty, Emotionally Vapid, Intellectually Void
",2017-11-09 00:00:00,2,"I was curious about this film because of its premise: a woman, Adaline, who seems to be immortal.I shall state the good parts first. Most of the visual direction is quite pretty and the soundtrack is rather lovely in places. The cast are very good too given the material they have to work with.However the script and story fall flat on their faces with astounding force. Adaline initially is put across as a bright but not exceptional woman leading a happy life. The rest of the film swings between portraying her as being a genius then to being a hugely irrational doe- eyed fool.STRONGER SPOILERS TO FOLLOWApparently she speaks a good handful of languages fluently but struggles to make the most basic steps researching the cause of her condition. Then she runs away from the governmental agency that want to research her condition. Then she can't figure out that maybe disguising her looks might Improve her choices of not being found. After all this she ends up with a man who's stalkerish behaviour would likely land him in prison. Then her daughter encourages her to get together with him. It's all a bit horrible.I can't say I saw anything romantic in this film. I couldn't see anything of substance whatsoever.ONE PARTICULARLY STRONG SPOILERI have no idea why the writers used this idea but.... I'd feel a lot better pointing this out...if a man follows you into a lift, tries to get in your taxi and then blackmails you by saying he'll give your workplace a huge donation if you go on a date with him, that's not romantic. That's a reason to call the police. And definitely, definitely don't go for a date with him in a dark cave."
" A Lack of Inspiration on All Areas of Production,
",2017-10-07 00:00:00,3,"The Age of Adaline is a terrible movie with a poorly developed plot and a cast that tries far too hard. It has an interesting set up as we follow an immortal woman named Adaline struggling to cope with losing people she loves as she lives on. However, it fails to deliver in all the potential this plot had, disengaging us from the story with an unusual narrator. The characters in this movie are also, quite simply, unlikeable. I had no reason to route for Adaline, she does not do anything intriguing enough or honourable enough to have me both respect or have any desire to follow her on this journey. Her love interest Ellis is also also a boring, two dimensional character. The cast could have saved these ineffective characters, but they had as little interest in this plot as the writers did. Blake Lively is not a likable leading lady, she never grabbed me or pulled me in to this story, and her complete lack of chemistry with Michiel Huisman made this movie even more difficult to watch. Harrison Ford does deliver a good, surprisingly passionate performance, but it was sad to watch him do great work for such a lackluster project. A regret from beginning to end. Boring and dull, The Age of Adaline is certainly not worth a watch. A woman who does not age struggles when she starts to fall in love. Best Performance: Harrison Ford / Worst Performance: Blake Lively"
" Awful film
",2017-09-15 00:00:00,1,"Good Lord what a dumb plot. Hey dad, I'm going to marry the 104 year old lady you were doing 40 years ago. Nope, not awkward at all. I wonder if he adopted the 70 year old step daughter. Good grief.... dumb, just dumb.I'm embarrassed that I wasted 2 hours of my life for this garbage."
" Because she's worth it...
",2017-09-05 00:00:00,6,"The side effects of staying wrinkle-free apparently include becoming REALLY good at Trivial Pursuit, and being more susceptible to sleeping with members of the same family... L'oreal should put that in the ads!To be honest, I was finding the characters insufferable until Harrison Ford rocked up... Then he did his thing, and with the gravitas he carries, he actually managed to make me feel the pain of a lost love... (even when the guy he's playing is not very kind to his wife!)All of this adds up to the message of the movie being that if you stick around long enough, the odds are you'll find something to enjoy!"
" Oh my!
",2017-08-30 00:00:00,1,"Beside all other reviews that state this was an awful movie, I came up with the following list:1. First of all, what was that narrating? If you're trying to tell us a real scientific fact, then narrate. The reasons narrator is trying to tell us about those accidents aren't facts. ""Adaline Bowman will henceforth be immune to the ravages of time."" We see this through the movie, don't need to say that.2. She looks like she's in her 30s maybe 40s, but the police officer suspects this? And they're going to run some test on her? What?3. Where were the emotions that bring them together? What did she see in him? His awful joke? His money? Oh, his hair!4. Finding a ship underground. IS IT REALLY SOMETHING? It shouldn't be nostalgic, interesting or something related, even to her.5. William concludes that Jenny is actually Adaline based on a scar, after about 40 years! Oh, I forgot, he's a SCIENTIST.6. In snowy weather you should slow down.7. Excuse me Mr. Narrator. If her body doesn't age, how come her wounds heal?8. ""Son, listen to me. Do you love her?"" should be ""Son, I slept with your girlfriend and I love her so much that I named a star after her. But if you love her, here is the key. Go sleep with her. By the way I'm Indian and this is Bollywood!"".9. Why did she want to be a mortal again? We didn't see any losses or relatives deaths (only her dog) or any other reason for her to become sad after she became immortal.10. And acting was ... you know."
" Romance for women, not men
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,5,"In a typical romance the man is very confident and does not take no for the answer. In the real world women are upset by men that do that. As a man, I can't enjoy a romance where the man is aggressive. The character in this movie is not overly aggressive but he is more aggressive than I can enjoy.I think another reason men often don't enjoy romances is that the guy is nearly always rich and powerful, even when it is a surprise for the woman. So that is another big strike against this movie from a man's point of view.In the beginning they say something about doxyribonucleic acid, which is DNA. I assume they said doxyribonucleic acid because they don't want their audience to really know what they are saying; the science of what they are saying of course is nonsense. So I think they should not have even tried to explain the science."
" Blake Lively is so pretty
",2017-07-15 00:00:00,5,"Blake lively is indeed pretty and charming. But this movie is just a quality awful movie. Plausible in somehow, but really freak film script, it arranges Adeline to fail in love with the father and the son. Even they were in love in different time period, but still is awful to me. Lastly, Blake Lively is so pretty, I still willing to spend 2 hours to watch her beauty, haha. But pick a better story nice time."
" Amiable enough
",2017-07-14 00:00:00,2,"This is a decent enough, thought not overly original, film that I don't remember made much of a dent in the box office.The reason for this probably is because as I said, there have been lots of similar films out over the last few years, and the fact that some of them haven't been that good.It features lots of likable performers giving likable performances, but it didn't do that much for me and is just another throwaway romantic comedy drama."
" Medical Inaccuracies !
",2017-07-10 00:00:00,8,"This lovely story, a mixture of age and love was almost ruined by the most basic of medical facts being ignored.1) A person's heart when stopped is not an indicator of death unless it remains stopped .2) A charge of electricity will not ""defibrillate"" a heart that is stopped because it is not ""fibrillating""Basically a defribrillator STOPs a heart in its unusual rhythm and hopefully the brain signal that keeps the heart going will restart the heart in sinus (normal rhythm)3)This wrong information was used twice in this film at the beginning and near the end.It cost $25 million to make this film but I would have told the makers for nothing about the parts that undermined an otherwise perfectly decent story. You don't need to pay a medical adviser just ask a nurse what a de-defibrillator does !! I blame Mary Shelley !! She created the myth that a great charge of electricity would not only start a heart but would give life to Frankenstein's Monster !! Future film makers please note - A great charge of electricity is actually LETHAL to a human being. Check that with the states that ever used the Electric Chair to end a life !!"
" Another actress
",2017-07-08 00:00:00,5,"This was a lovely concept for a movie. Living for years at the age of 29. It's a pity they picked Blake Lively. She didn't act, she strolled through the film using only 4 different expressions on her face. The costumes were beautiful, the scenery nice, but the acting or lack of it made the movie not so good. Don't waste your time unless you have absolutely nothing else to do."
" Scars on her hand did, why did the birth-mark on face not?
",2017-06-01 00:00:00,8,"A very good love story but I have something that I think might be a goof.Scars on Jenny's hand brought Williams to knowing that Jenny is Adaline, but why did her birth-mark on her face not? It should've been easily brought him to suspicion at very first time."
" Sleeper Hit I Didn't Know About..!
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,10,"One film that stretches out and endearingly takes you on an amazing life + long journey... Blake Lively livens up this film with her gorgeous presence both physically and emotionally. She was the right person for this and her make up was top notch for the different ensembles she portrays. The film takes an incredibly fresh stance into a what if situation. This situation deals with 'what would you do' should you be so unique? Would you be happy and settle down, or would you run for your life? Eloquently, the script, timeline, voice-overs and overall story where an amazing new take that Hollywood righted itself on. The pain is felt in the movie as the character of Lively 'deals' with so much adversity - and loss. Yet, she shows incomparable strength, strife, and can-do effort that you root for her throughout the film and also, can easily understand her 'why'. The movie also touches on how she impacts people throughout her life and tries to stay away, from ever being seen... It's a lovely, fresh and inspiring plot that will surely pacify the pickiest of movie goers. I simply am SOO glad I sat down to watch this and am confident, with what the story teaches you - YOU will too! Cheers!"

" Beautiful People with Unbelievable problems. Solved!
",2017-05-13 00:00:00,4,"Adaline is a beautiful woman of matured youthful appearance. And what an appearance. She has a secret known to only one other person, her closest living relative. And oh how that secret weighs down her life. Why it should weigh down her life is not really made clear. Many other people in her situation would have a lovely long long time of it. The film has an omniscient narrator who tells us more than anyone in the film actually knows. Most of what he tells us is fantasy designed to explain the plot. Now the movie is well presented, well cast with nothing but attractive people of all ages, and everyone behaves with great propriety and civility, uh, except for one truck driver. We are led by the capable acting, the cinematography, the music, and that mellow-voiced narrator, and if we allow ourselves to be led by the nose through all this we'll probably swallow this story like a French macaron cookie. Only if you have one of those little logic bots in your head which independently follows the action to see if it makes coherent sense,your little bot will probably be screaming that the motivations don't ring true to most rational humans, that the coincidences are multiple and over-the-top, and the cohesion of the story calls for a cooperative (and magical) comet. On the plus side, I watched the whole movie. It went down like the afore-mentioned macaron. I was happy to see Blake Lively had escaped that horrible Oliver Stone movie (Savages), Mr. Huisman was very good looking, as were Harrison Ford and Ellen Burstyn; the actors who played the younger versions of the characters. The movie was totally watchable, just watch it with a bag full of macarons. Colorful, a little sweet, and with no nutritive value."
" New take
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,4,This is most original film adaptation of Frankenstein I have seen yet. It's truly amazing what you can do with the power of lightning these days. I guess back in Mary Shelley's time there was less options for the application of the sky's power. If you're not a traditionalist you may like this. Maybe for fans of Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet.
" Almost Perfect
",2017-04-06 00:00:00,9,"The last time I reviewed a movie was 4 years ago when I reviewed ""About Time,"" on which I wrote the following comment, ""I just feel like the genre is really worn-out, with not much fresh to offer."" Of course, ""The Age of Adaline"" is not a time travel movie, per se, but there is so much in it that feels like time travel, and I have to say it is fresh, and I loved this movie. The casting was excellent, especially Lively as the lead, and Harrison Ford. Ford's part and his ""moments"" were just too important to be trusted to anyone else. I just can't imagine anyone but him being able to pull it off. Perfect choice. So why 9, and not a 10. The narration! Just a bunch of unnecessary stuff that was really a blotch on a near perfect film, and took me out of the ""romance"" of the story. I actually did my own version and dubbed music from other parts of the film over the narration, and I have to say, not only was nothing lost, but I had the joy of watching this film in its perfect 10 version."
" A must watch film for everyone irrespective of age.
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,10,"The movie The Age of Adaline (2015)is an interesting movie. Adaline faced with agelessness due to an incident that occurred when she was 29 made her live a life faced with numerous threat; always changing her location, finding it difficult to love. Try to watch this movie with at least member of your family if you haven't."
" A Better Director Could Have Made This An Award-Winner
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,6,"When the closing credits rolled on ""The Age of Adaline"", the first emotion that I felt was disappointment. Obviously, that disappointment wasn't based on the movie being terrible (as three stars isn't a terrible rating), but rather was disappointment that such a great concept/opportunity was wasted with such poor direction and scale.For a basic plot summary, ""Age of Adaline"" tells the story of Adaline Bowman (Blake Lively), a woman born in 1906. When the audience meets Adaline, however, she is living in the year 2014 and looks to be in her twenties. How is this possible? In a series of flashbacks, the film explains how Adaline was given the mysterious ""condition"" of never aging past the looks of a young woman. Recognizing that she is such an oddity and fearful that she will be used as a ""test subject"", Adaline has resigned herself to living on the runnever staying in the same place for too long. That is, of course, until she meets Ellis Jones (Michiel Huisman), a man who is enticed by her mystery and refuses to take ""No"" for an answer. Also, it just so happens that another Jones family member (played by Harrison Ford) might have more of a connection to Adaline than anyone knows.The concepts behind ""The Age of Adaline"" are dynamite, put simply. Age-old themes of love, aging, generations, and family are touched upon within the magical, mysterious environment created by Adaline herself. Plus, Lively is truly a beauteous sight to behold (makes you wonder why she hasn't had a bigger cinema presence before now). It would really seem like a slam-dunk that this movie should not only do well, but perhaps even to the point of winning awards. Remember ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button""? ""Age of Adaline"" has even that award- winner beat in terms of overall potential emotion and mystery.Sadly, the direction of this movie is a mess. There are a number of choices made that really perplex me, and speak to either flat out poor direction or a wrong tact in creating the film. For example-The flashbacks in the film are narrated montages, really violating the ""show, not tell"" general guideline of great cinema. I wanted to see/experience what was happening, not just hear about it. -A plot line involving a celestial comet falls so embarrassingly flat one must wonder how it wasn't scrapped on the cutting room floor. -One of the core components of the film is the romance aspect, and even that is mostly unsatisfying. This is mainly because it seems like the film-makers don't want to see Blake Lively actually emote (whether she can or cannot do this as an actress I do not know). Instead, it was more like ""let's put her in a bunch of evening dresses and see what happens"".Overall, I think that the main problem with ""Age of Adaline"" comes from the perspective. I was hoping for a film heavy on the mystery with some solid characters to back it up. Instead, this is mainly a vehicle to showcase the beauty of Blake Lively and establish her as a starvery little more or less. A bit sad, considering that this film had the potential to ""do it all"". When all is said and done, ""Benjamin Button"" actually turns out to be a better experience for those looking for similar themes. That film was made with care, while this one lacks oh so many things."
" Slow and boring
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,4,"First things first, let's establish which genre this film falls into. Don't be fooled by the fact that the plot has an underlying science fiction/fantasy element, or tries at times to be a costume drama, or borrows a bit of its style and approach from Benjamin Button. What we have here is a chick flick.And not a very good one. The central story concerns a woman who for reasons unknown has become immortal and lives through the ages while all around her age and die. This brings with it complications and makes her unsure of how to live her life. This idea has been done before and more compellingly. It seems as though a man in this situation would put his time to good use chopping people's heads off in massive sword fights, with Queen blasting away on the soundtrack. Unfortunately Hollywood has decided that a woman in the same boat doesn't get very much to do, and none of it interesting. The main character's immortal existence is spent staring sadly out of windows, and occasionally having boring sappy relationships with boring sappy men. And what plays over the soundtrack is most definitely not a kind of magic; instead it's dull, slow piano to make sure you're as depressed as the main character, with the occasional burst of Kenny G playing on dinner dates. I'm conscious that I'm not really the target audience for this kind of film. But surely the audience for ""women's pictures"" (and women looking for decent parts in films for that matter), deserve more to look forward to than an eternity being miserable in nice clothes and deciding whether to have a boyfriend or not?"
" The End of Movies
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,1,"At the end of this movie, I realized most of all that I had just aged 1 hour and 52 minutes without benefit of the protagonist's signature characteristic, but, most painfully, without anything to show for it. It was quite literally a waste of time. There is nothing learned, no sense of uplift, no emotional journey. Just WTF?Okay, there's a beautiful star. It's well-acted by all, mostly. Technically, no problems, it's a well-built piece of work. Just a massive turd of a story, and what struck me about those most responsible for what fails in this film — the screenwriters — was how they listed themselves: J. Mills Goodloe ... (screenplay) & Salvador Paskowitz ... (screenplay) and J. Mills Goodloe ... (screenplay)J. Mills Goodloe ... (story) & Salvador Paskowitz ... (story by) I would just observe, Mr. J. Mills Goodloe, that you apparently INSIST on taking 3 bites of this road apple, and at least Mr. Salvador Paskowitz has an amazing personal backstory.Now then...doesn't it bother anyone that Adaline is schtupping the son of her former lover? Why doesn't it bother either Father or Son Jones? That's some serious ick factor right there. At least Mama Jones (Kathy Baker) is appalled, and rightly so. A much better ending would have been that Adaline reunites with Papa Jones, her former lover! That would at least say that love is ageless!My least favorite character is Ellis, just because. More ick. Manipulative and creepy/stalky. Ladies, I don't think his schtick is charming.My favorite character is young William Jones, played by Anthony Ingruber, who, despite an unfortunate name, absolutely nails the part of a young Harrison Ford...and it seems he's primarily from New Zealand!But finally, I guess there is something I've gained from the experience of watching The Age of Adaline...I think I'm going to give up watching movies. There's just too much danger that the next movie will suck as bad as this one does, and that's a big chunk of your life you're not getting back."
