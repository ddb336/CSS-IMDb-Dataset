" INTILLIGENCE & Beautiful some Truth & Some Truth
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,10,BEST SHOOTING & Acting & City in Film is superb it was blockbuster but due to Release of Rustom affects. Please rate after watching such content of this precious Movie for future motivation for producers to create flim like this.
" Innacuracies in details but a terrific movie!
",2020-12-30 00:00:00,8,"There definitely were several drawbacks in the film, especially an overwhelmingly disastrous work from the costume designers, wherein the approach of the film wasn't to specifically depict the ancient times, but who cares? The movie was more than just amazing and entertaining and a very simple story line was the basis of the movie. It certainly was a very commercialised depiction but I would say, that is the very essence of the movie. The costumes, as I said, were in no way ancient and was very modern infact but it still complimented the idea in which the movie makers intended to shoot the movie. Definitely do watch the movie, its worth watching!!"
" Same old story, same old characters
",2020-12-25 00:00:00,6,"The story is formulaic, down right predictable and unexciting. The characters right from the hero to the Supporting characters to the extras are clichèd, The hero who's destined to save everyone, Check. The heroine, the beautiful heroine for the hero to court, Check. The chubby supportive sidekick, Check. The loving worrying parents/guardians, Check. The bad guy with bad guy looks and his
son who is equally bad, Check. ohh and the clichè village extras who agrees with whatever the hero say, also Check!The film loses focus at times, and the pacing is hurt mostly by the romance angle, it takes way too much time, and there isn't much chemistry between the actors.
The music is good, and the choreography is nice and fun to watch. The original background score is also amazing, it fits with the atmosphere of the film, and it'ss enhances the fighting sequences.
The performances are fine; Rothik Roshan is good in lead role, he's got the looks and all and he played the character as it should played, nothing special about his performance. Pooja Hegde looks good and does a good job when it comes dancing, other than she's bland. Kabir Bedi played the typical villian and does a fine job at that. The rest provide good support.The production value is spot-on: The city layout of Mohenjo daro is breathtaking, it's very detailed. The costumes and props are all very fitting of the era. I particularly like how they use to tell time.
All in all, Mahenjo Daro has great entertaining value with its stylish production design and costumes but suffers from derivative and formulaic story and characters."
" Highly underrated, its a must watch movie. If you liked Bahubali it's a sure watch
",2020-10-10 00:00:00,10,"No doubt a good story and Hritik Roshan obviously a killer combo. The only thing that this movie was CGI in the begging fighting scene with the crocodile. After that the movie is great. The development of story is good. I dont know what more were people really expecting out of it. I mean it has a good plot, fighting scenes, a childlike rommance, and a good story buildup.
Many critics said that several points has been overlooked regarding history, but this is a movie and first priority is to enjoy it. And that's the point one must focus on. If you really want to see a historically perfect movie, then documentaries are best place to meet your requirements.Enjoy the movie, definitely worth watching."
" Let's learn pronouncing mohen jo daro first
",2020-07-30 00:00:00,4,"The language spoken and written during Indus Valley Civilization is not readable today. It is related to Sanskrit and Prakrit but it's a different language. The language used in the film is modified hindi. The word 'Sapna' was changed to Sapina, 'Vyapari' becomes 'Vaapari'. I don't see any logic in constucting your own language for a film. But you can't expect this much from Bollywood when they can't learn how to pronounce Mohen jo daro. The way they were saying is the english pronunciation. It's actually Moen-jo-dado and not Mohenjo daaro. It means 'Mound of dead'.Secondly, Mohen jo daro is only the modern name of that city. The people of that era didn't call it by this name. And who would name their city the mound of dead ?The story is full of cliche. There is not anything new. A man (Sarman) goes to a new city, falls in love with a girl, there's a city chief whose intentions are not good, Sarman discovers his unknown past, the girl turns out to be the fiancee of chief's son. Now, you what to expect, Sarman has to get the girl and dethrone the chief. But why they really needed this story to be set in that era? It's simply a masala Indian film. Nothing more.The costume designer deserves a special mention. Costumes of Pooja Hedge were straight from twentieth first century. All women were wearing modern clothes. And what was up with Kabir bedi's crown, it looked so childish.Acting was generally bad, no one was impressive.Despite heavy promotions, it was a flop. Desevingly so.The set decoration was good. It was a high budget film, they didn't use cardboard sets. The city, the dam, looked real. The landscape was captured beautifully. And the story was kind of enjoyable albiet cliched.I wouldn't rate it one or two. I don't think it's that bad. But when working on such a budget, they could have hired a better screen writer."
" An insult to indian cinema
",2020-06-18 00:00:00,1,"If you are here to decide whether to give this film a try, please do not waste your time. Mohenjo Daro is a rare film which unites the critics and commoners in opinion. It is,in short, an insult to Indian cinema.It is hard to find a more poorly researched, more unauthentic period film than Mohenjo Daro. The characters look like models wearing contemporary clothing. The ""copper"" looks like cheap toys. The set looks like a temporary exhibition arena, unbelievably cheap, arrogantly plastic. But we could have forgiven these. What is unforgivable, is the poor script, poor story telling, and no editing at all. There is no cohesion as well. You would not care if the farmers get oppressed or if an innocent girl is getting sacrificed. The struggle that is supposed to connect audience to the film does not impact us. Instead, we constantly are reminded by the inaccuracies, which Mr. Gowariker claims to be ""artistic liberty"".Ironically, the only entertainment comes from historical inaccuracies. They are so many and so clear that you stop counting them after about 10 minutes into the film. At that point it becomes a comedy....a way too long, 100 something crore budget comedy with big names associated with it.Unfortunately, Mohenjo Daro is not just a poorly made, forgettable film by a whimsical director. The name bears one of the finest excavation projects undertaken ever. To make a half-boiled film about Mohenjo Daro without much homework and preparation is an insult to the most advanced city of its time, most sophisticated in many ways."
" Don't waste your time.
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,1,What utter tripe! More proof that Bollywood is just pathetic. Waste of resources.
" Good movie if you are intelligent enough
",2020-05-13 00:00:00,10,"Supposedly people had rough mood so I see many one star reviews but honestly it was really good and if you are intelligent enough and curious about things it ll create a good impression,your last thought would be people should make these kinda movies"
" Anachronistic script and weak actress but Hrithik shines
",2019-10-22 00:00:00,4,Rating4/10This long historical (!) fantasy drama is watchable despite anachronistic script and weak lead actress. Hrithik makes a game effort and succeeds in holding our attention. Ok climax marred by dodgy visual effects.
" A historical movie for kids
",2019-07-03 00:00:00,6,"The story is good. Full of optimism which is suitable for kids. Unable to say about its authenticity but still watchable. It has historic elements along with love story and a 'good bad' fighting adventure. Few things are well shown like antique items found in that site. The lower and upper city, the language, symbols etc. At times it loses the uplifting grip. Its long length also contributes to its ungripping moments. Edges are well covered. Kids will love it. Ashutosh Sir interest in history is clear from his visualisations. Best wishes for him in upcoming projects.
NOTE: Skip a few songs."
" Not up to the mark.
",2018-12-26 00:00:00,6,"Story is not so good .its like thpical Bollywood film,predictable story.some of the scenes are fabulous,acting was good,hritik as usual (performance is v.good). Something better was expected from Ashutosh gowarikar like 'lagaan'.
Overall a good enjoyble movie .
GUYS THEY HAVE TRIED LITTLE DIFF. FROM OTHER MOVIES
LOOKS OF MOVIE,ACTION SCENES WERE REALISTIC."
" What a waste of time and talent!
",2018-09-28 00:00:00,2,"I was stunned by the colossal fail of Mohenjo Daro. The script was awful , the direction was terrible and Hrithik was disappointing. This movie was a disaster on every level. Don't waste your time."
" A Comprehensive Crap !!!
",2018-09-05 00:00:00,1,"How it all started that idea of watching this movie came to my mind . I was reading a very interesting history book where I came to know about this 5000 years old civilization of Mohenjo-Daro . Trying to be over smart ! I thought book will take at least 12-15 hours to tell me about it while movie will explain it to me in mere 2.5 hours . I was actually impressed with movies like Schindlers' list where you can get whole phenomenon of Holocaust in 3 hours . But believe me ! Watching Mohenjo-Daro was a really bad decision . Normally when you are angry with a movie , you call it a Bad Movie ! But Mohenjo-Daro is a movie with Bad script , Bad Acting , Bad Lyrics , Bad Music , Bad choreography , Bad Costume designs and above all , Bad Direction . That's why I call it Comprehensive Crap !! Even if someone pays you 50 dollars to watch it once , don't try to watch it otherwise you'll keep regretting for a very very long time . Highly Avoidable . Never ever watch it !!!"
" Mohenjodaro the story of real indian ancestors how they immigrated to ganga river from sindhu river
",2018-08-31 00:00:00,9,"It is not only action romantic movie ,it is every indian's movie everyone should watch once ,this movie showed how sindhu people immigrated to ganga river from sindhu river after the flood spoiled the whole hadappa and mohenjodaro ,there is good action with romance and some unknown facts ,one thing im surprised that indians in sindhu cvilization were dont know about horse,and culture is awesome ,I dont know why people rejected in box office it was disaster but it is one of the best movie among ashutosh' movies ,and movie has pure hindi and ancestor indian accent, once again i would say that every indians should watch this movie if u want to know about our ancestors route and lifestyle."
" Worst Hrithik movie ever
",2018-08-31 00:00:00,1,"Pathetic. Waste of time. Did ashutosh just pay money to put his name or did he really direct. If he did direct, i guess its his time to quit. Looked like a cheap hindi serial. No acting, no proper CGI. Why ????? did this movie ever come out."
" Such a Disappointment.
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,3,"I prefer International films, especially Asian and Hindi, and have enjoyed Hindi films for many years, but this movie is just stunningly awful from the opening scenes on all fronts. It does not measure up to the best of India, nor does Hrithik Roshan, who is a better actor than anyone would know seeing him for the first time. What a shame."
" Very Weak storyline, NO LOGIC
",2018-08-13 00:00:00,2,"Movie should have very strong script Unlike other big movies for example western movies hero fights for a big cause not for family
Thats the weakness of bollywood 70% of movie concept talks about making ''couples'' and always character of heroine is burden on story that is only there to show some half naked body which is nothing to do with storyI give only 2 stars because of poor producer who spent money on that movie"
" Bad Story, Bad Graphics, Bad Music, Worst Script!
",2018-08-06 00:00:00,1,"What were the makers thinking??!!!!
The movie's story is same old with cheesy dialogues and very bad graphics!
Don't even bother watching this one..."
" Mohenjo Daro, if not highly recommendable, is a good film
",2018-04-24 00:00:00,7,"Mohenjo Daro leaves you with a bag of mixed feelings. The film has a frequently told plot and I personally feel there is no harm in doing so only if done with a perspective never seen before. There are intense moments in the movie that perhaps for a split second make you go back in time. Ashutosh Gowariker makes a solid backdrop with his research and reflections on how the city really must have functioned. Moreover he tried to tie chords and create a feeling of genuineness with some symbolic facts weaving them into the story for effect (for e.g. the glimpses of foreign buyers in one scene showing the extent to which Mohenjo Daro had spread its arms, the Sabbath around The great bath or the drowning of the famous artefact 'Dancing doll' in the last scene). Alas many will not register this so the motive behind that gets forfeited. The biggest problem with the film is its weak script. The intensity that certain segments of the film hold fails to multiply throughout. I would have loved to see some fantasy aspect to it which Mr. Gowariker as a script writer did try to hint in the beginning (Roshan's dreams) but then again chose not to weave the thread further. He probably was too strict on keeping it real but then again a story without a lasting effect is ordinary life.As far as the characters are concerned, the only focus has been put on Roshan's. Hrithik is a great actor and no doubt he carried this one perfectly but instead I would like to talk more about the leading lady. Pooja Hedge's character, unlike her male lead, is very one-dimensional. Sadly, you just don't feel anything for her apart from registering the fact that she was immaculate and looked so pretty. I kept on wondering- so much could have been achieved through her! My curious mind derived a plot of its own where in the obtuse part of the story dealt with characters escaping through the drowning city and our leading lady showing real mettle through a great deal of struggle while she tries to save her people and unite with her love who is stuck somewhere in the other part of the doomed city. Probably this all could have created a nice contrast to her life as we saw it. Probably this all could have left a dent in the mind of the audience. In truth, even though everything was admirable, 
Mohenjo Daro majorly lacked in variation of emotions. The underlying plot was good but not enough to justify it as a whole.Still, overall, if Mohenjo Daro isn't highly recommendable, it is a good film. Discouraging anyone would be rejecting the art behind the grand thought. Camera work is good and Mr. Gowariker is definitely a skilled director but not even a great potter can achieve anything without a well-kneaded soil. Backed by strong music from AR Rahman (Tu Hai is simply ethereal), Mohenjo Daro leaves you somewhere in between loving it and settling the agony with a stale opinion. Simply for the same sake, do watch it if you plan to. The finale is well thought and wonderfully treated.Visit the Blog:- quickiereviewsmovies.blogspot.com"
" This movie deserves to b flushed down the toilet.
",2017-07-16 00:00:00,1,"The film opens in 2016 B.C. with Sarman, a young man from the village of Amri, who lost his parents at a young age. Sarman kills a crocodile that has been terrorizing his village's fishermen and is hailed as a hero. He asks his uncle, Durjan, to allow him to go to Mohenjo Daro to trade their family's goods, but his uncle refuses. Sarman attempts to sneak away to the city at night with his friend Hojo, but is caught by Durjan, who relents and allows both friends to go. He gives Sarman an amulet that contains an inscription of a unicorn that Sarman often sees in his dreams, suggesting he use it only in a life or death situation."
" This one is DOA
",2017-06-24 00:00:00,4,"I was very sad watching this near 3-hour bum-test, not because it is a poor movie, but because it is a poor movie made by Gowariker. This is the man who made Lagaan (2001) and Swades (2004), he is no amateur, he definitely knows how to make epic movies. However his latest is the ultimate pandering to populism exercise, nothing here feels original. Mohenjo Daro just sucked from the get-go with a ridiculous scene of a leaping crocodile. Never mind the iffy CGI, the moment I see a jumping crocodile the movie will need to take a lot of effort to immerse me in its story again, and it never did. Yes, the set design may look spectacular but it isn't something that is better than say any episode of Game of Thrones and for all the effort that Gowariker spent on the set design and costumes, he should have spent more time with the storytelling instead. This is as bland and tasteless as they come. My mind mapped out every emotional beat 5 minutes ahead of time and I just hate it when I am 100% correct. Everything here looks like it copied from other movies, from biblical movies to epic dramas. The costumes are a point in comedy – Chaani, the Chosen One (actually I don't even know what she is chosen for) is a Hall and Oates Maneater, a traffic stopper, she will make your mouth hang open like a dog waiting for treats, but she is in the most ridiculous garb – a push-up bra, a valley opening all the way from the throat to the navel and slits in her skirt that reach her inner thighs. If that's not the worst, she has the most ludicrous head-dress that rivals Queen Amidala. How can she act with the weight on her head? The villains are archetypal carbon-copies. Yes, a sneer here tells me he is a bad guy, a pouted face tells me he wants to kill good guys and a horned crown as wild as his shoulders should make me pee in my pants. The fight between Sarman (Hrithik Roshan) and Moonja (Arunoday Singh) is terribly and lazily choreographed – one punch the other three times and the role is reversed, the sequence repeats a few times. The same old fight I have seen thousands of times in B-grade movies. Demise of characters feels like punctuations in a laboriously long one-note script. Who writes villains like this, not Gowariker please. But you know what, I just cannot blame the actors. To be fair to them, they do look like they try really hard to push jewels out of the script, but no amount of effort can accord a miracle. The writing is just plain lazy. 3 hours is sheer punishment. The towering watery climax does feel inspired, but by then it just couldn't lift the movie from the six feet under pit that was dug by a crazy crocodile.This one is DOA.PS – I apologise for the lack of paragraphs. I only wanted to dissuade anyone from wasting time with this, but the words just poured out. Don't let the trailer fool you."
