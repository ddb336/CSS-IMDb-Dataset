" A great movie
",2021-03-16 00:00:00,10,A man finds his talent and his talent tears his life apart. The only way out is to use this same talent to free himself.
" excellent updated version from the 1974 original.....even better
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,9,"I was surprised how good this was especially marky mark's performance. i had little hope but was really impressed with how he did it. i saw the original when it came out and less that a year before i saw this remake, and while the original is a bit broader, I think this one is better.things better in original from 74:female lead , gangsters, university life/professorship. maybe the last one is on me, im just not able to buy MW as a prof. paul sorvino in the original was the single best thing in that version. the john goodman role just did not do it for me.things better in new version:michael k. williams. he is absolutely white hot in every role he does. he saved that part of the film. I also think he brought out something in MW, their scenes together were absolutely the best of the movie.
the mother role played by the always amazing jessica lange was a great part of the new one. her last scene, her performance made me want to learn more of her character. not a flaw in the movie but a testament to her always economical portrayals. she does not chew the scenery but you know she's been there.
the overall mood/lighting/illegal betting parlors, that was done much better in this version.Even: the lead role. both Caan and MW are great and both have larger than life personalities off the screen. they each brought something unique. MW certainly did not try to copy that performance. MW showed the brashness many gamblers have, but he was also good at NOT being that tough. I bought MW as an addicted gambler more than I did Caan. but still they are even.Overall I was happy to see homage being paid to the original. wont give away things, but the headband, mom and bank, the '3', all really were good additions to the film. highly recommended."
" Donot waste time
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,1,"I demand 1 hour and 50 minutes back...i will sue director and producer for wasting my time...pathetic story, script and role of main character MARK...it was so irritating to see the nonsense story."
" De ja vous .?
",2021-02-02 00:00:00,10,"My feelings of personal relationship with this film was not from gambling , simply from an early tumultuous and tormenting life !
So, yess , no spoilers and a lot of personal reminders for me ! This was very real for me as a frustrated and often indecisive
confidence lacking character!, which Wahlberg does not display, albeit that is how and why I strongly relate to this film.
This film portrays a fascinating one dimensional narrative which brilliantly maintains its narrative at full flow throughout !
And no no no , my review in no way should be misunderstood as me being in any form similar to his portrayal,
A very clever plot, from scene to scene which I only understood at the film conclusion ? As has been said by earlier reviewers
who clearly did understand this film, gambling is only used allegorically. Al round well chosen casting, although to his undisputed
credit mostly accolades to Mark Wahlberg. additionally taking responsibilities as producer .Also directorial congratulations in order..
Thoroughly enjoyable and as a full package excellent value for the film duration. Finally, there will inevitably be some viewers who
may not get this , although if they read as many of the reviews as possible, they might relate more favorably to this unique film
which is without doubt worthy of every minute of screen time ."
" The Gambler 2014 on 4k ultra hd
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,9,"The Gambler is a different movie. It's not action packed or hilarious or any of that. It's more of a character study of some sorts. An english professor gets in over his head when he deals with the wrong people to support his gambling addiction. That's pretty much it. The basic storyline. Mark Wahlberg went through a fascinating transformation. His last role before this one was the muscular Cade in Transformers. In this film he's gotten so skinny you can't help but admire his dedication to his roles. This film isn't for everyone. Its not a big budgeted film. It's a small dramatic film to tell a story, not to entertain per say. John Goodman is great and very menacing. The visuals on this film are absolutely stunning. The audio is clear and my favorite scene is Mark Wahlberg running in the end to M83's 'Outro'. Mark Wahlberg explains this scene in one of the special features which for this type of film is surprising to see as many features as we receive here. If you like a good story with good performances and no explosions then this film is for you now on upgrade Upscaled 4K and Dolby Vision coming soon on paramount 4k ultra hd release November 2021"
" Misunderstood gem
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,8,"The Gambler is about a man who seemingly has it all but keeps falling into the gambling addiction trap... or is he? In a very compelling manner, with a small but incredibly strong cast, this film teaches us a valuable lesson about stakes and how we might never reach our full potential - or even be free - if we are not prepared to take risks and truly put things on the line. It's actually a very strong film, with a couple of flaws yes, but mostly with a very potent lesson that many reviewers seem to have missed... probably thinking the film was actually about gambling. It's not, it's about taking risks. If you miss that point, you'll misunderstand the film and won't get the ending. But now thay you've read this and you get the idea of risk taking (without me spoiling anything), it'll be well worth your time and inspire you to go out there and be bold. Good concept, good acting, good message... good film."
" Tragically Misunderstood
",2021-01-08 00:00:00,9,"The film has nothing to do with gambling, that's just the vehicle to tell the story. Jim Bennet is not a Gambler, he literally explains this several times throughout the film. He sees life in 2 ways, total defeat or total victory & would rather die if he doesn't get it. The girl is what gives him a real love, a real house & a real thing to do everyday. His love for her is enough for him, he found what he was looking for, life. Phenomenal film."
" Atrocious Experience
",2020-12-16 00:00:00,3,"As much as I was interested watching this it just left me clueless as they speak profusely with no context, it's like I'm missing some part of their conversations. So I'd rewind trynna pick up what they are talking about and it's just super vague and halfway in the movie it gets irritating. Only upside is having the acting powerhorse Jessica Lange doing every scene and emotion flawlessly."
" Very shallow story
",2020-12-08 00:00:00,1,"Waist of time to watch, this should be put in sci phi genre not drama, very unrealistic story with no useful outcome wat so ever"
" Nearly two full hours of Mark Wahlberg pouting
",2020-11-12 00:00:00,2,"It is rare to witness such a contrived mess of shallow characters, unrealistic dialogue and self-indulgent posturing."
" How Unfortunate...
",2020-09-26 00:00:00,5,"Rupert Wyatt's 'The Gambler' (2014) is a crime drama/thriller about English professor and gambler Jim Bennet (Mark Wahlberg) who finds himself in a sticky situation since he owes a lot of money to certain people.
This film is a remake of Karel Reisz's 'The Gambler' (1974), a film I unfortunately have not seen yet.'The Gambler' (2014) is a film that had so much potential, but ultimately wasted it by being too predictable and unambitious! I really wish they would have changed up the story and set up the characters differently to sharpen the conflict much better! Basically they should have completely rewritten the script with the basic concept still in mind. Instead of staying so true to the original (which I am suspecting by the original film's description), I would have rather seen a more original story with a rather unique take on the whole 'gambler' story! I think the film would have benefited greatly from a nice revamp! I think it's genuinely unfortunate (and that's the whole theme of this review; that this is an unfortunate film) how you mess up a concept with so much potential, yet you feel the need to please the general audience! Therefore, by doing that, you compromise the quality of your film by releasing a product that is neither innovative nor special. It is totally predictable at the end of the day and THAT is what's so unfortunate!I think it is fair to say that I was disappointed by the film, however this cannot be said about the actors who did a truly great job. Specifically I would like to pick out Mark Wahlberg and Brie Larson who are basically the centrepiece of this film. Brie Larson plays a shy student who opens up towards her teacher Jim Bennet. She does a phenomenal job at capturing the behavior of a shy girl. What doesn't make any sense though is how open she becomes within the matter of just one or two days. It makes no sense whatsoever! This is not Brie Larson's fault! She was clearly told to act that way. However why she would have that switch in her behavior is beyond me! This is just another one of the huge problems with this script!
Mark Wahlberg plays his character with such incredible skill! Whether he plays the gambler, the teacher or the troubled individual, he is so authentic and real! It is a real joy experiencing this man's performance and just getting to appreciate it! There were so many times when I could match specific reactions or ways of his talking with actual real-life people that I have met over the years. At times, the film had me constantly digesting Wahlberg's performance! This is what acting is all about!
As nice and intriguing as Mark Wahlberg's and Brie Larson's interactions were, they didn't really go anywhere with that. At one point you barely saw Larson ever again, for no reason whatsoever! I could literally pick this film's script apart all day long, but quite frankly, I don't want to plus this review would be insanely long. Besides I don't want to make this a spoiler-review either!How is the film's pacing, you might ask? It's alright, there are definitely moments that could feel a little long for some people, but I need to be honest, I wasn't bored!How rewatchable is the film? Since there is no pure satisfaction to be found within the movie (no matter the beginning, the middle or the ending), I would guess that this film should probably only be seen once.Overall, 'The Gambler' has definitely left me feeling disappointed even though it does certain things very well, but ultimately fails to deliver a satisfying and thrilling product! This film could have been great! The concept seemed promising, but the execution was the big problem! 5/10"
" Awful,
",2020-09-22 00:00:00,2,"No one is that stupid as a gambler..I was hoping he'd lose every bet,and he did."
" How did I miss this?
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,9,"Looking through Tubi.. ran across Mark 😁 so of course i had to watch. Very good, sad & happy. A lot of good actors. Mark is always excellent, Jessica Lange and John Goodman were also very good. It'll definitely make you want to pull for Mark to bring his life around. The college girl with the crush on him 😍
He'd sell his soul to the devil for $$ and almost did. It's a definite favorite now. Give it a try, it won't disappoint but then again, it's Mark 🤷‍♀️"
" ""How much you know Lamar...."" yes, seriously
",2020-07-17 00:00:00,2,"That is an actual line from this movie. EDIT: I was initially harsh on wahlberg, and he does suck. But the script and direction are just as bad if not worse. who thinks this crap is relatable? this makes me think i should start writing screenplays because they will just take anything.......wait, I'm not a connected type, so I guess it'll never happen.
Original review: This would have been great, with a real lead actor. he forces his lines so badley, he is too over confident. a shame for such a potentially good film."
" Redemption
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,8,"This movie is all about redemption. So, with that in mind, I think it is a good piece. I give it 8/10 stars for that."
" The feeling of emptyness
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,8,"Have you ever felt like there is a hole in your life that you so desperately want to fill?
That no matter what you do this hole keeps getting bigger?
Well this is the main theme here. Our protagonist, an individual with a good job, a nice house and good looks, keeps handling the emptyness that he feels with gambling. He is not happy with what he has achieved in life and instead has compromised with a mediocre one.. At least that's how he sees it. Gambling, as drinking or smoking etc., is a way for people to fill holes in their souls and lives. Those actions most oftenly lead to self harm through debt and addiction. In this case it was the debt that led to the protagonist dealing with some dangerous folks.
The take away message here is that this hole is not something filled by more success, or by just more money. This hole is filled by finding what makes you feel alive and happy. In this case, it was love."
" Could have been better
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,5,Stylish direction and good music but the script was pretentious and the lead character was totally unsympathetic. By the end I was hoping that he would lose the last bet.
" Quite OK gambler-inside-look
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,7,"As unfortunately I have quite a long and bad gambling history I could definitely get the main character. Talented and maybe because of that not happy with a common life. Leading to wanting more and then little by little getting into this nasty ratrace of self-destruction where your whole life is about getting money....and then in an attempt to set things right losing it in one night. I recognize the attempt of shifting money around: loaning from person B to pay person A. I recognize the disappointing of the people that love you the most: girlfriend, family and friends. I recognize the dispair...the rope that getting tighter and tighter around your neck. Making you do things you never thought you would do and makes you despice yourself. I regret some unrealistic things . The strop-strategy (doubling till you lose) is not the strategy a gambler follows . And the ridicolous amounts people keep on loaning him, even knowing about his debts. All in all I liked the movie. But probably if you have no feeling with this insane gambling world, you would just say: what a stupid morron...and in fact you are right."
" Really good drama
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,7,"Despite being tedious and annoyingly creating its own problems, The Gambler is still a really good drama that manages to come to a very satisfying conclusion. Mark Wahlberg is great. Brie Larson, John Goodman and Michael K. Williams all give really good supporting performances. Rupert Wyatt's direction is also really good. The soundtrack is excellent and the music by Theo Green and Jon Brion is good."
" The Writer's Ego is Manifested in the Film's Dialogue
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,3,"The themes in the film are those chosen by a man who wants to communicate their own perceived intellect. Mark Wahlberg's character is written to be an intellectual who has no regard for anything less than excellence. The character's lines are written and performed as if they're all incredibly profound, when in reality, they aren't all that deep at all, but instead they sound embarrassingly self absorbed. A college professor that fancies him or herself as smart and unfulfilled, but is actually just a snobby weirdo, would be the perfect subject for this film. This college professor also wants to sleep with their most attractive students, who are half their age. Wahlberg's character makes senseless decisions, but keeps his self-perceived genius intact by writing all of his foolishness off as a byproduct of his nihilism. It's such self-absorbed BS. The lack of humility and entertainment value in the writing results in a slow moving film that lacks any true originality. A good poker movie would create a certain order of circumstances that would result in a kind of suspense that is all its own, but relates to the themes of the film (ex. the oreos in Rounders). This movie lacks any type of character in that way. You see Wahlberg's character play blackjack and roulette, which are games almost entirely based off of chance. Poker requires more skill and savvy, which makes it a better game to makes films about. Everyone knows how Blackjack is played, and while it may have an element of excitement, you would never see the ""World Series of Blackjack"" being played on television, because (outside of counting cards) you can only get so good at the game. A person who doesn't count cards, yet plays Blackjack as if they were a genius is a perfect comparison to the protagonist and writer of this film. Pseudo-intelligence is this movie's very make-up. Brie Larson is a perfect example of someone who would believe in this script. The reason the disdain for mediocrity is so prevalent in this film is due to the writer's personal projection. He is a mediocre writer, who badly wants to be seen as a genius. The self-obsession one must have to enjoy this film is truly disturbing. The acting isn't bad, and the stakes are presented decently so the audience can believe in them, which makes the movie somewhat watchable."
" Gloomy
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,4,"The film is centered around a man and his distructive behavior toward himself, that includes gambling. Its very slow and gloomy with a simpilistic plot that has little action and no heart. The only good thing about the film is Mark Walberg, as he masters the role of Jim, his acting never disappoints. Not a film worth viewing twice."
" What looks like a nice beach might as well be a sneaky quicksand
",2020-01-16 00:00:00,7,"I am not a gambler myself, but as all humans I am addicted to some things. Here seducing desire to play and self-desctruct is constantly hanging over Mark Wahlberg's character.Many moments seem illogical, atmosphere getting darker and more tense with every step of the story. This is exactly what any addiction looks like in my opinion, you do stuff that eventually brings you down and the sanity slowly fades away.The final outcome might be only one: win or lose agains your weakness. Through the span of the movie you cannot actually see what it's gonna be, which makes it a good thriller worth spending time on."
" ""A wise man's life is based around 'f... you'.""
",2019-12-06 00:00:00,7,"This is a tough movie to wrap your head around. Jim Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) is a literature professor by day and inveterate gambler the rest of the time. The only inkling we have why he gambles uncontrollably relates to a fatherless past and an inability to cash in on a skill that would put him in the stratosphere of money earners that only sheer talent can command. Wahlberg never imbues his character with any qualities that would make him likable, which makes it a mystery why student Amy Phillips (Brie Larson) takes a liking to him. If you think about it, Professor Bennett never once offered evidence of why he believed Miss Phillips was a dynamic writer, he only said so in class during his diatribe on how much he hated his job. For her part, she might have felt it so intuitively, but because Bennett seemed to be blowing smoke most of the time to his students, how would she ever know to take him seriously?I have to say, in addition to the unlikable characters, some of the principal players looked physically as bad as I've ever seen them. Wahlberg, who lost sixty one pounds for his role, looked emaciated and weary, perhaps a function of the life style his character was living, but I thought he looked terrible. Jessica Lange, who portrayed his mother, looked like her face was made of plastic, and I'm sorry if that offends anyone but she didn't look like a real person. And what can one say about the shirtless John Goodman? If a Star Wars chapter ever needed a repeat appearance from Jabba the Hutt, Goodman looked like he could nail the part.Story wise, not a lot of credibility on the part of Bennett's backers. After 'only' fifty grand in the hole, I couldn't imagine anyone fronting the cash Bennett was asking for to continue his losing spree. It all worked out of course, and one would have to assume he himself was the other unknown gambler who bet the house on the basketball game. There's a lot of reading between the lines in the picture's resolution to make this a Cinderella story, and a lot of question marks one would have following the end credits."
" Hollywood Fantasy; as real as ET - The Gambler
",2019-10-22 00:00:00,3,"I like Mark Wahlberg and John Goodman. The production values are very good. The story is quite believable, at least until the end, which is quite unbelievable. The problem with this film is that there is no protagonist. I wanted Wahlberg's character to either commit suicide or get killed; so I was disappointed. I wanted his character to die, so that other people in his life could live. Interesting that he paid back the bookies before paying back his mother. He obviously could care less about his mother. His pseudo-intellectual character of a ""gifted"" college professor was not Wahlberg's fault; it was the writer's fault. The writer here is living in lala land, and I don't mean the musical. The suffering that real gamblers encounter when they hit rock bottom is a hundred times worse than the crap that is handed out in this phony baloney film. Who cares about some silver spoon who spends his mommy's money? Not me or anyone I know from Union City. My friends would all say he got what he deserved and we would all be rooting for the ball to come in the red. His new girlfriend would have been much better off without him. His mother would be much better off without him. In real life, you lose your girlfriend/wife, your kids, your job, your self-respect, your best friend and sometimes your life. And his students are certainly much better off without him because he is a crappy professor. James Caan was much better in the original, but he deserved the same fate as the main character in this film. He deserved to get iced, but because he was a silver spoon, he had lots of extra chances. In the real world, it is just not like that at all. You either pay, run, or get iced. The rest is Hollywood baloney."
" Very slow movie
",2019-07-29 00:00:00,4,Mark wahelberg is a star he is not fitted in this movies character. Too much slow movie.
" Surprise: The original is better
",2019-07-16 00:00:00,5,"I watched the remake of The Gambler before the original and thought that it was okay, despite its myriad flaws. There were a few bright points (some good acting by costars here and there), but it is somewhat difficult to forgive a so-called gambling movie for featuring an addict whose ¨strategy¨ is to double his bet every time, taking completely crazy risks (a hit in blackjack on an 18--and he gets a 3?), until he loses it all. Clearly the guy is suicidal, but could he not have played with a bit more finesse?The Mark Wahlberg character is basically an unhappy creep, which is supposed to have something to do with his mother, it seems. But it makes it very difficult to sympathize with or care about him, especially given that he is such an inept gambler.The ending, which I´ll leave to the viewer, is simply unforgivable, and an insult to the original film."
" Loved this
",2019-07-13 00:00:00,9,"Wahlberg excellent in this , superb acting from him. Strong story and compelling, really good movie to unwind to and highlights the bad side of big time gambling addiction"
" my notes
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,1,Tried watching it like six different times but could never get through it (1 viewing)
" 10/10, period
",2019-06-11 00:00:00,10,"The first time I saw this film, tbh I didn't really get it. I just thought it's a film about a gambler who was trying to quit gambling. But at that time of my life, I was realizing things(don't come for me Kylie Jenner) It occurred to me that I constantly found myself in dilemmas that were caused by my twisted pursuit of perfection. As a result, if I couldn't get something to perfection, I may as well just don't get it in the first place. Then I looked back to this film, the character Tim became understandable. (Even though I am a rather different person now.)
It's quite a relatable film to me. We should appreciate this kind of films."
" Hysterically Rotten Remake
",2019-04-16 00:00:00,2,"In 1974, a dark, brutal piece of cinema was unleashed upon the public; it was called ""The Gambler,"" and it provided an unflinching glimpse into one man's hypnotic downward spiral into self oblivion. Today it remains an incredible work of art, for those with the stomach to watch it. Flash forward 40 years, and along comes this ""afterbirth"" of a legendary film. This snide, self indulgent wreck of a movie starring the current 'piece of meat' action star, ""Marky"" Mark Wahlberg, serves as a testament against remaking GREAT films. Any snot nose upstart director, who thinks he can top, or even come close to the glory of the original, is tragically delusional, and is setting themselves up for failure. In this case the failure is 2014's ""The Gambler."" Modernizing the story to current times, replacing the beautiful, vintage landscape to today's boring, flat aesthetics , we now have a stripped down story of a mumbling idiot with sloppy hair, (James Caan had great hair and always looked perfectly groomed in the original) who throws away mommy's money on longshot bets, when he isn't mumbling in front of the university class that he is teaching. This putrid remake has nothing going for it. It's redundant, it's grossly inferior to the original, and worst of all, it's artless, and ugly. Who needs this trash? I will finish with a word of advice to the current ""slop-crop"" of young film makers; you don't remake GREAT films. There is no reason to. Doing this will only make your lack of talent more obvious. If you must remake something, choose movies that had good ideas but were failures due to someone else's mistake. You cannot improve upon perfection."
" Different zoner
",2018-07-30 00:00:00,7,Director deserve praise for depicting harsh reality of gambling & its trauma .. Brilliant performance of mark wahlberg add more interest in movie.
" Why the blue money ?
",2018-04-16 00:00:00,7,"This is not a review, only a question. Why the money used in the film is blue ? Is the story supposed to be taking place in Canada ? Well, it's obvious that it's not taking place in Canada."
" I got a need
",2018-04-08 00:00:00,4,"Jim Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) is an arrogant unlikeable mediocre literature professor, novelist, and one of the world's worse blackjack players. He is self destructive and much of the movie involves him attempting to get out of his gambling debts, getting the money to help, but then not using it. He has an odd relationship with one of his students (Brie Larson) and looks to borrow money from a shirtless John Goodman, a sight I could have been spared. Goodman revives his famous line from ""The Big Lebowski"" but not with the same bravado.The film attempts to study the character of Bennett and bores us by trying to make him ""complex"" when all he really was just a moody underachiever dissatisfied with life, welcome to the club. About an hour into the film I was yearning for the awful Kenny Rogers version, willing to settle for his Progressive commercial.I would recommend waiting to see this when it becomes a cheap rental.Guide: F-bomb.

" a study in vice
",2018-02-24 00:00:00,7,"The vice of gambling inspired quite a number of literary and cinematographic works, starting maybe with Dostoevsky's novel which shares the name with the films that it inspired, until the almost masterpiece movie ""House of Games"" written and directed by David Mamet. ""The Gambler"" directed by Rupert Wyatt is not an adaptation of the great Russian writer's short novel but rather a remake of a 1974 film that featured James Caan in the lead role. There are enough reasons to watch this 2014 version of the story with Mark Wahlberg in the lead role, even if you have seen or not the older film.The film history does not lack heroes (or anti-heroes) who lead a more than honorable life and/or have a respected profession at day, while spending their nights in vices of all sorts. Most of the characters of this kind are women, but there are also men like Jim Bennett, a decent and passionate professor of literature and novel writer who spends his free time in gambling crazily money that he does not have, borrowing from all possible bad guys, ruining the trust of his mother and of his girlfriend. At some point in time the viewers ask themselves whether he is playing a survival or a suicidal game, as he invites trouble and seems immune to the any danger or concern as soon as he walks the door of a gambling place. The response is in the character of gamblers which escapes reason (there are a few lines that I suspect were borrowed from Dostoevsky). His chance to survive depends upon getting rid of the addiction.Rupert Wyatt's ""The Gambler"" is written more like an action movie than as a character study. At some point in time the hero borrows money from three different mob groups, and uses the cash to cheat each other in order to try to save his skin. The influence of the gangsters movies of the 70s and 80s is visible, with reverences to Coppola or Sidney Lumet. The atmosphere, the darkness and even the humor are present in the right doses. While the action is quite satisfying the quality of the film derives mostly from the actor work of Mark Wahlberg who succeeds in this film to deliver one of the best roles in his career, with an intense rendition of the combination of the emptiness and despair of the intelligent hero who is aware about the falling spiral path of his life, but has a hard time fighting to prevent it. Supporting roles are played by fine actors like Jessica Lange, John Goodman, and George Kennedy (his last movie!). I liked less the very final which may be a little to conventional cinema relative to the rest of the film, but the overall impression is better than expected."
" Lifestyles of the Insufferably Self-Hating
",2018-02-04 00:00:00,5,"Our protagonist is in trouble plenty. It is not enough that he is the heir to one of the richest men in the state, that he has met with success as a writer, and that he is a college teacher. He must work out his own salvation through his own self-destruction, burning his loan sharks(s) (there are several), his family, and his none-too-bright student, with whom he engages in more self-destruction by having sex with her.Yet the line must be drawn somewhere. He is unwilling to sacrifice the life of one of his student athletes, who initially resists a loan shark's offer of easy money, then gives in, and then switches to get a better deal. And, yes! He plays great ball. Then he plays flaccid ball. Then he plays great ball!And all are redeemed.Uh-huh. The sole redemptive moment in the story is John Goodman's character's ""F*ck You"" speech, which is an illustration of what an idiot the protagonist has been by squandering more than two million, when he could have lived modestly and told the world, ""F*ck You!."" Goodman really delivers on this, and the moving is worth watching just to catch the wisdom he imparts.A big fan of Mark Wahlberg, I am not sure that as a kid from Southie he is quite able to carry off the look of the disaffected and dissipated rich. Better will be forthcoming, I do hope."
" Gripping
",2017-12-29 00:00:00,10,"Great cast, Great cinematography, Great musical score....don't get why this film never received the respect it deserved. Mark, Brie and Goodman at their best."
" What a Jerk
",2017-10-25 00:00:00,4,"Wahlberg! I expected a lot more. Normally when I see he is in a movie it turns out pretty good. But not this time. When you don't like the main character it is hard to enjoy the movie. If you ate at a restaurant and the food was bad, would you go back again? No. Michael Williams and John Goodman did an excellent job portraying big time bad guys. But it was not enough because Markie Mark was unlikable. I also found the story predictable. My advice. Don't watch this."
" Very Fun Movie
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,7,"The Gambler is another one of my favorite Los Angeles tales. It centers about a wealthy professor who's gambling addiction gets him deep with the sharks, and he could care less. It's a great vehicle for Mark Wahlberg, as a take away from his straight action movies, to one that is more deep in thought and just outright cool.This is a great watch for movie fans. It's very funny at times, and goes pretty low and deep as well. Very dark movie. It deserves 8 in my book, but I guess 7 works too.7 Stars"
" Another compulsive gambler happy ending
",2017-10-02 00:00:00,6,"The two reasons I was interested in the film was that it starred Mark Wahlberg and gambling, which I am both a fan of. I did like how it just dug right into thick of it, showing the main character at his worst, and you do get moments of cringing as you picture yourself in his shoes losing away more money then anyone should, especially money that you don't already have. Then it was pretty much a calm story until the very end. I felt at times you weren't getting enough of the main character, seeing deeper into how he is the way he is, so that you could better understanding of the ""addiction"" he has. It was tough to tell if he was truly suffering from a mental disease or truly believed in having it all or nothing. It was good to see a small female role instead of a large one, because it would have taken from the true tone of the film. You get to see that he is capable of controlling his desire for all or nothing as his last decision shows to be only with a woman and not one penny in his possession. Unfortunately for this kind of movie it caters to only a certain demographic so that is why you won't be seeing a high box office number. For the folks that are part of this demographic they will get a good gambling thrill and added entertainment with Mark Wahlberg's natural talents of adapting to any type of character he plays."
" 100% pure junk
",2017-07-18 00:00:00,1,"The only two things that I found to be incredible in this extraordinary example of useless junk are - the amount of first class actors engulfed in a meaningless and pointless ""drama"" and the exact quantity and type of prohibited substances the screenwriter used creating the most disgusting, unappealing and completely, insultingly imbecile principal character, very professionally played by Wahlberg though . In fact everyone's acting is of upper level - the only problem is that their efforts are completely wasted. It looks like heavy drugs interfered very heavily with the constructing of the story - for the characters of the ""thugs"" seem more like loving kings-magicians, understanding and forgiving towards their debtors like in a bad comedy, the girl find it OK to sleep with her teacher, finding as the most attracting treat of her lover his dumb ""ability"" of losing every cent of money he can grab from anyone. In other words having to face the dilemma of watching this mess or going to the dentist to get most of your teeth fixed - choose the dentist - it would do much better."
" I can't summarise a masterpiece.
",2017-07-09 00:00:00,10,"I have seen a wide variety of good and bad, dark and happy films. A lot of the films are trying to impress a large crowd to reap in the rewards, however its rare to come across a film which is so intricately based on certain members of our society.Jim Bennett's character may be hard for a lot of people to watch it, which is the reason for the bad write up; however I have never connected or understood a character in a film like I did with Jim Bennett's. I am also sure this is the same reason why a lot of others love this film. Without being too crude, I felt a huge weight off his shoulders when he payed the loan sharks back, and to have a connection like this in a film excited and astonishes me. I also think Mark Wahlberg was the perfect man for this role, and he brought so much more to the film that I wasn't expecting. The film is called The Gambler, its based around gambling but yet it couldn't have anything any less about gambling, it focuses on the stress you bring on your self, the inner hatred and self pity, it also focuses on the strength of romance and inspiration, the two go hand in hand, and what Jim did was go from one extreme to the other. I also really liked the fact that his shirt gets brighter as the he gets closer to what he wants, even though he may not realise he is slowly achieving it."
" Well Acted, Poorly Developed,
",2017-06-27 00:00:00,6,"The Gambler is a decent movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a great cast. Mark Wahlberg makes some very interesting acting choices in this movie, losing weight for the part and portraying the character in a way that really stretches beyond his usual style. I also loved the chemistry between him and Brie Larson, it was definitely the strongest aspect of the film, in my opinion, as it was pure and felt very real.The structure to this film is a bit of a mess, we are given a bunch of plot points and different reasons for this character to be in dept. It was clearly trying to overwhelm us with this characters situation, however, it just took me out of it when they began to throw too many things at me at once. As well as that, we are never given a real reason to like the character of Jim Bennett, he is irresponsible and everything that happens to him is entirely his fault. He may have redeemable qualities, but not enough for me to support him. He does pull through towards the last ten minutes of the movie, but that does not make up for ninety minutes of him being an arrogant, self centred individual. It has it moments, but there are a lot of movies similar to this that are much better. Good performances, but lacking in originality, The Gambler shines on few occasions, and I would not recommend it. An obsessive gambler must get his life together to pay off his debts and be with the one he loves. Best Performance: Mark Wahlberg"
" Cinematographer
",2017-06-02 00:00:00,7,"The plot of the film is quite interesting, it's easy to watch. This film is about a man who loves to gamble. The situation goes so far that once at stake is not the amount of money, but his life. The most interesting thing is that during the day he is an ordinary literature teacher who teaches young people life, and at the same time does it quite unreasonably with her. Excitement - that's what he can not live without. Jim absolutely does not care what happens to him, his motto is ""all or nothing"". In the title role, one of my favorite actors of our time is Mark Wahlberg. He perfectly entered the image and opened the character. Also worth noting is Bree Larson, who played his apprentice, who knows about his second life and is trying to help him in some way. Such a life may seem cheerful, but sooner or later everything comes to an end and it is necessary to make a choice: to stop or make a risk that may be the last. I liked this movie so much that I watched it a second time. The most important point and for what I'm ready to watch it again and again is the ending. She keeps in suspense and then lets go. There is nothing superfluous in the film. I advise everyone to watch this movie."
" Truth
",2017-05-16 00:00:00,8,"To say that this film is a work of fiction is an atrocity. To say it is the work of a visionary writer would simply be wrong. The simple compelling aspect of this work of art is that it tells the truth. The truth about society, business, power, and most importantly-the human mind. In short, I myself am not able to adequately explain the beautifully written truths of this movie. After all, i'm no genius."
" ""I think you're the kind of guy who likes to lose""
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,7,"You can't accuse me of The-Original-Is-Always-Bettering director Rupert Wyatt's remake of ""The Gambler."" I've seen Karel Reisz's 1974 original with James Caan but Mark Wahlberg's version doesn't disappointed all on its own. One thing I will say, though, is that Wahlberg is as good as his Oscar-nominated role in The Departed.""The Gambler"" - Rather than just be a simple thriller against inevitability, however, The Gambler does a great job showing how low Jim is and the allure of addiction that put him there. Toback wrote how his original script spoke to many who were caught in the lifestyle just like he was and if Monahan's version is even half as effective I believe it. There's a palpable danger underlying each frame and not just because of the hardened criminals popping in regularly to flex muscle. When Lange's Roberta returns to buy her son out of trouble one last time you can't help get the wind knocked out of you as a result of her heartbreaking performance. This is the sight of a loved one helpless to do anything when the only solution she can provide is a huge part of the problem.It's crazy to think someone so ill-equipped to be a teacher in The Happening can believably pull it off in The Gambler, but here we are. A lot of it has to do with the type of person the character is because Wahlberg excels at troubled, fast-talking con men like the Jim Bennett behind his nameplate's occupation. It's one thing to be innocently excited about science and bees and a complete other to engage a room of co-eds with straight talk to humanise star tennis player Dexter (Emory Cohen) and basketball prodigy Lamar (Anthony Kelley) while also admitting the world's commodification of them. There's little Gray area for Jim, you either have it or you don't no matter the vocation. Life has always been all or nothing for him, gambling simply dis-tills it to a starker black and white."
" An under-rated movie
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,8,This film on contrast to the title is not about a gambler but of a man on the path of self destruction due to his personal problems/conflicts.The beauty of the film is the intelligent narration of the film which makes us keep thinking about the movie even after it is over.We need stories like this to understand the complexities of the mind and you need to understand the protagonist to see the beauty of this film.I'll give it an 8/10.
