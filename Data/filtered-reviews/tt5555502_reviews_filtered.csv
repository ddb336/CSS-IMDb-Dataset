" Few kinks but a great watch
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,7,"Although racism was and to some extent is quite deep-seated in USA but there are still few pockets in France where it does prevail. The prejudice however, is not entrenched. This is a light-hearted film based on the life of Seyolo Zantoko, the father of the musician, Congolese French rapper Kamini... there may be few kinks but it is a great watch."
" Fantastic movie
",2021-02-24 00:00:00,10,"Great movie, should of been nominated for awards as well as some recognition for an international film! I have watched this film over and over and I love it just as much the first time I had watched it. Where were the critics on this one? Clearly great movie missed for well deserved awards."
" Sappy movie for dullards
",2020-11-17 00:00:00,4,"Embarrassing to watch. Could have been so much better had they simply not talked down to the audience. Reminded me of the crass movies that come out of Hollywood. I wish that I had that time back. Good actors, lousy direction that will probably have the cast leave this film off their resumes."
" Nice integration story
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,10,"Lost in Picardy a black doctor succeeds after some difficulties, in a small village.
Nice story, with a lot of good actors.
A special word for Rufus, always precise and so human."
" A refreshing comedy
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,8,"A great family movie to depict a very difficult start for this family. Great writing to describe
humble pride, lightness and forgiveness.
The lead character is excellent. The build-up of his emotions is very well built. I just shouted of rage at the same as he did in complete symbiosis with his struggles! Haha"
" French Doc Martin meets Africa in a heartwarming film
",2020-01-11 00:00:00,8,"Such a beautiful heartwarming French film. If you like 'Doc Martin' and French comedies, then you'll love this, which is like a combination of them both.The fact it's based on a true story just makes it even more enjoyable. The performances were great, and while it took me a little to get into, once I did, it was like being wrapped up in a comfy blanket. It has a lighthearted vibe and managed to juggle humour with sensitive racial issues effectively.At times it even reminded me of 'The Vicar of Dibley' - if the village had received an African doctor instead of female vicar. It has a really nice score throughout, and enough emotional scenes to ensure Kleenex never runs out of business. The final scenes in particular were a fitting climax and great way to finish what was an enjoyable story.I'm a sucker for triumph over adversity stories, and The African Doctor is a fantastic little film with a big heart."
" A very good and touching story.
",2019-12-30 00:00:00,8,"This film is based on the real story of Seyolo Zantoko, a doctor of Congolese origin who installed his doctor's office in the village of Marly-Gomont amnd stayed there with his famille from 1970 to 2009.
A touching story telling the integration of this family in this village with humour (the white cows looking at Anne , the man explaining what is a leek): little by little the family begins to be accepted and appreciated by the people of Marly-Gomont.
The performances of Marc Zinga (Seyolo Zantoko) and Aïssa Maïga (Anne Santoko) are excellent, so as the performances of the French actors and actresses."
" Good but not more than entertaining
",2019-08-06 00:00:00,8,"I passed half an hour without getting bored. But, the movie didn't present adequate profoundness by means of dramatisation and set of comic elements. It has a very similar grammar of Hollywood comedic dramas inspired on true stories.Nevertheless, African Doctor deserves 8-stars since it tries to deal with an actual matter, racism."
" Great movie!
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,8,"This movie was heart-warming, funny, sad, and eye-opening, all at once. Showing the difficulties faced by an African family in rural France, in being accepted into the community. It's been on my watch list for a long time, and I'm glad I finally took the time to get around to watching it!
Relatively clean, so would be appropriate for children who are old enough to have discussion and understanding of the themes in the movie."
" Arenmete
",2019-05-24 00:00:00,6,Turning a rather controversial story into a lighthearted comedy was a good idea. The story could've used some more gravitas though.
" Based on true life story
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,9,"The film present clearly challenges in 70er in European villages difficulties of African academicers and if people reduce their prejudice, they can built also good relationships."
" Heartwarming!
",2018-11-27 00:00:00,10,A real story about a hard theme told in a light way.
" A lititle clunky
",2018-10-30 00:00:00,5,"A little clunky but delightful foreign film with good subtitles. Good acting, directing, and narrative."
" Important story, solid movie
",2018-06-01 00:00:00,7,"""Bienvenue à Marly-Gomont"" deals with the mayor of a small village in France, who has been searching for a doctor to run his office in his hometown for years. When he meets a young African student of medicine, he hesitates to offer him the job but finally agrees to test the waters. What follows is a story of stereotypes, racism, mutual understanding and warmth. First of all I think that the choice to make a film out of the biography of this special man is a right one. It's one of those most people never heard of but one that can evoke questions and possibly even changes. Personally, I am not a huge fan of the film's attempts to be a part-time comedy because they take a bit of its magic away. Instead, I would have preferred a more sensere approach, to support the rollercoaster of feelings this family had to face. But otherwise time flies by watching this movie and it is sometimes good to tell a story of hope in somehow desperate times.All in all this is a solid film with a beautiful background that sows that integration is tough on both sides but can create true beauty and strong bonds."
" Brilliant satire about race, culture and living as an immigrant within a different society!
",2017-11-23 00:00:00,10,"Absolutely loved this charming and light-hearted satire! A lovely family friendly perspective on race and living as an immigrant in an unwelcoming community. The daily challenges that the main characters face make for a touching tale that will make you laugh and cry.As an expat myself, I can definitely relate on a personal level with the incredibly truthful way this film portrays the challenges of trying to immerse within a new and very different society."
" Delightful!
",2017-08-05 00:00:00,10,"A wonderful Movie.Funny.Sad.Inspiring. Honest.Not only is the (true) story intriguing, the scenes are compelling and the casting superb. It is essentially the story of a black doctor from the Congo who had been educated in France who accepts a position as the town doctor in a small farm community north of Paris but is himself not accepted by the locals, most of whom have never even seen a black person. It is very well put to-gether and the end product is a film that entices and entertains. In addition to the principals, there is a superb cast of the local characters, some of whom are indeed characters. It will tug your heart, tickle your funny bone and stimulate your mind."
" Uplifting family-friendly fun.
",2017-06-27 00:00:00,9,"This is a a very pleasant film. It portrays an Congolese doctor, and his family that immigrate to Marly-Gomont in la France profounde and the struggles they face. It is not a dark tale of racism, but it does portray a genuine family's struggle with genuine prejudice. The film is vivid in its cinematographic contrasts. The grim and somber scene at the armistice memorial when the colorful loud Congolese family arrives is a cringe-worthy example. The rain and gray are disrupted by color, in this case African.The end of the film is wonderfully satisfying as well.(I saw this on March 14, 2017)"
" Current events elevate the material here, but it's a good film nonetheless
",2017-05-09 00:00:00,6,"""Bienvenue à Marly-Gomont"" or ""The African Doctor"" is a French 95-minute movie from 2016. It premiered last summer in France already, but took almost a year to get here to Germany. It is directed by Julien Rambaldi and he is also among the three writers who worked on the script for this one. And with current events (refugee crisis, rise of nationalism in Europe and the USA), the subject is really relevant these days too, even if it plays several decades in the past. Actually with the French election several days ago and the two extremely different candidates, it could hardly be any more relevant now. This film depicts the life of an African who studied medicine in France and ends up as the village doctor in a little place in the countryside in the North of Paris. The film depicts the struggles from both sides. On the one hand we have the family, his wife and kids, who have their own struggles in adapting to life far far away from their home and also getting along with what is really xenophobia and what is nothing serious. On the other hand, there is the local townsfolk and most of them are really really biased when it comes to the new doctor. The consequence is that for the most part of the film, there are simply no patients, but there are huge phone bills as the wife keeps calling her relatives. Luckily thanks to the help of a farm worked and a pregnancy and birth at the right time things take a turn for the better at some point. But there are still obstacles like the law getting in the way of the protagonist's profession in the generic major conflict that every movie has towards the end.I must say I enjoyed the film for the most part. There are strengths and weaknesses and the film needs a little while to get going, but all in all it is a rewarding watch. I liked for example how the movie did not depict the white guys in here as evil or truly racist, but they were just unable to cope with the new situation. I even think the bad guy, the one who wants to be major is not really racist (maybe his aide is), but just power hungry. And actually, the movie also refers the bad situation in the central character's home country and shows how cruel and ruthless people make it big there with the one guy at the dinner table. So the blacks also have bad seed among them. This reference also can be seen in the white bull scene, which was perhaps the best and most metaphoric moment of the entire movie because it was such a great parallel about the Black man and how the white beast perceives him. The bull wasn't evil, just confused and there was a good proverb at one point too about how people are scared of what they don't know. The second this fear vanishes is the moment his doctor's office has many people there.I also think the comedy wasn't bad there, for example the gospel scene at the church or the two sick guys who come first to the doctor's office, even if the ending of this scene was of course pretty negative. So even if not all the intended funny scenes worked out properly, you can get some solid laughs while watching I believe. Other weaknesses include the football daughter part near the end, which was a bit weak and unrealistic in my opinion, even if the general idea of using football to make a bridge that helps against the prejudice was a nice one. I also think the attempts by the filmmakers to include shades in the characters, to keep them from being entirely good or evil, black or white (no pun intended), did not always work out to a satisfying degree. However, some of it did work out, so there is nothing so bad in this movie that it was a negative deal breaker. And the very ending was actually a bit on the touching side too and made me curious about the central character's life. Of course, real-life references always help. With this movie here, France showed Germany again how to make a quality comedy on a subject that is still important today. Shame on us we have to live with garbage like ""Willkommen bei den Hartmanns"" being the ""best"" out there. I recommend ""Bienvenue à Marly-Gomont"", certainly worth checking out."
" Touching movie about the efforts of a African doctor to integrate into provincial French society
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,8,"The African Doctor nicely depicts the struggle in which a late 20th century African immigrant may find himself while trying to settle in provincial Europe. The cultural clashes are very funny to watch, but sometimes they seem a bit overdone. Nonetheless I think the struggle hits pretty close to reality. Without being a depressing movie, The African Doctor delivers quite a touching story."
" Highly recommended
",2017-03-21 00:00:00,8,"For the first time in many, many years, I'm giving a 10 out of 10. In 2006 one of the movie producers composed a song about this family and this story. The same ""rapper"" is also in the movie and this is the story about his family and being accepted in the 70s in the middle of a conservative nowhere. Anyway. He might not be the best movie made but it made me laugh and the end made me cry. I loved it and I was expecting this for a very long time. Merci Kamini."
" True Comedic Story
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,7,"What could have easily been a bleak outlook on racism and the struggle for acceptance by an African Doctor and his family in a small village turns into a fun and light-hearted comedy the whole family can enjoy.With its comedic ups and downs, and a standout cast playing the family, this movie is a fun, good-quality time guarantee."
" A timely reminder for us.
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,8,"A film for our times, though based on true story decades ago. A black Congolese doctor relocates to French countryside with his family and face racial distancing by the locals. It's an uplifting story on how the father and the kids turn both the locals and their mother too with their talents and unconditionality. In current times when divisive tendencies are on the upswing, we need more such reinforcements.The movie is a simple one, perhaps made with modest means. But it is highly effective at what it attempts. The acting, especially of the female lead is very good. And the kids as well as the male lead are delightful. The villagers all play their role well."
