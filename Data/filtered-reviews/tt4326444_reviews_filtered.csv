" Another delightful Almodovar
",2021-04-04 00:00:00,8,"Compelling and beautiful. Maybe not one of his best storylines, but still very enjoyable."
" Ceap melodrama, with great colour correction!
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,5,"Cheap melodrama, with great colour correction! Almodovar is such a bad director and a great painter!"
" ""Your absence fills my entire life and destroys it.""
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,10,"After buying the book The Pedro Almodovar Archives by Paul Duncan,I took a look at what was the most recent movie covered in the book. Whilst having known about the title,I had been unaware that this was the film maker behind it,leading to me meeting Julieta.View on the film:Originally planning to call the feature Silence and as detailed in the Archives book by Paul Duncan that he originally planned the script to be filmed in New York, but ""In the end I was defeated by uncertainty; I wasn't sure of the script or my ability to direct in English."" leading it to be left aside for two years,until he picked it up again for a set in Spain version which he feels ""Admirers of Alice Munro should see in my Julieta a tribute to the Canadian writer.""Moulding the material two years later on a opening shot of red fabric with a heart beating within it, which gets folded into a shot of a small naked man sculpture that gets placed into the hands of Julieta, setting off a recurring motif when Ava is depicted creating a small male sculpture, that represents the power of woman as the creator of man, and the shared personal straight they hold in the hands of writer/directing auteur Pedro Almodovar's creation.Revealing later that he and his regular composer Alberto Iglesias had long discussions over finding the right tone for the score,Almodovar again displays his remarkable eye for colour coding stylisation, with Almodovar & cinematographer Jean-Claude Larrieu placing red (a prominent colour across Almodovar's works) into every shot, stirring up a intense atmosphere from the grief and sorrow running in the blood of the characters, which is reflected on screen in a bright red.Draining all colour bar the beating red from bringing light to Julieta's life,Almodovar reveals that he went into the production with the mind-set that ""From the outset I had in mind that Julieta is a Drama,not a Melodrama."" which Almodovar expresses with a thoughtfulness of toning down his distant flamboyant colours, for startling pristine white peeled along wide-angle shots of a grieving Julieta living a hollow existence, detached from all the colour of life.
Covering the first half of Julieta's life,Adriana Ugarte gives a exceptional performance as the younger Julieta, who even in moments of happiness in the early days of her marriage to Xoan are carried by Ugarte with a melancholy pinned underneath, which Ugarte rings dry of sorrow when tragedy lands on the shore.Absolutely mesmerising when sitting alone mourning on a bench against the plain white background, Emma Suarez links her older Julieta to Ugarte's younger version, with the aftermath of the tragedy remaining red raw and being pressed down by Suarez on the withdrawn shoulders of Julieta.For only the third adaptation he has ever done, Almodovar bakes the clay of three unconnected short stories by Canadian writer , which fittingly results in a fragmented state that captures Julieta, who each time she tries to put her family photo past together, finds that the fragments never neatly slot together.Leaving a mark on Julieta from the death of a stag seen outside a train as she makes love with the newly-met Xoan, Almodovar takes to heart the original Silence title of the picture, with the grief and sorrow being carried silently by Julieta, who Almodovar gives a wonderfully fragmented ending to, after Julieta has waited for her family with a bright red cake."
" Melancholy And Graceful
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,8,"This is Pedro Almodóvar in his most minor key, a melancholy tale of a woman who by chance meets a childhood friend of her estranged daughter - and who then decides to write to her, telling her much she didn't know that we as viewers see in flashback. It's a tender, moving story with threads running through it - not least the colour red, but more subtly the sense of clarity emerging through some kind of mist or distortion as the mother discovers as much truth about herself as she's passing on to her daughter about their own relationship. The conclusion is graceful and quietly eloquent, befitting a film that isn't among the director's very best but still deeply satisfying."
" Beautiful Tragic Story
",2019-10-27 00:00:00,10,"It's the story of a woman who finds herself in the inevitable storm of what we all call life. She is not a victim but another piece of a big puzzle that creates a major picture of how our human condition is in this world.Beautiful contrast between past and present.The scene when Julieta is helped out by her daughter from the bathtube is a bit exaggerated but the message is delivered.The end scene was clever as it beautifully states a new beginning without unnecessary embellishments.In my humble opinion, this is one of his best films."
" A tale of loss
",2019-10-01 00:00:00,9,"The eponymous Julieta is a middle-aged woman living in Madrid with her boyfriend. They are about to move to Portugal, something they have been planning for a year. The day before the move Julieta bumps into Beatriz, a friend of her daughter Antia, who she hasn't seen in years. She learns that Antia has three children of her own. Now she can't bring herself to leave Madrid; in fact she moves back to an apartment in the building she'd lived in when she last saw Antia. Through a series of flashbacks we learn how Julieta met Antia's father Xoan, a fisherman; moved to his coastal home; had Antia; lost Xoan; moved to Madrid and ultimately became estranged from Antia.Having seen a few of Pedro Almodóvar's films I half expected the 'soap opera on steroids' method he commonly employs to great effect... instead this film had a more natural feel which suited the story. The story of how Julieta came to have and then become separated from her daughter was told at a gentle pace but never dragged. It inevitably provided plenty of well-handled emotional moments. Emma Suárez and Adriana Ugarte impress as the older and younger versions of Julieta and the rest of the cast are solid; making it easy to believe in the characters we are watching. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of character driven drama.These comments are based on watching the film in Spanish with English subtitles."
" An incidental Amoldovar
",2019-09-29 00:00:00,7,"Pedro Amoldovar's films are never boring, but in spite of his acclaim, I've never truly loved them. In 'Julieta', she follow a woman's journey through life. Various things happen, some of them very traumatizing. Some make her realise that she didn't fully understand what was happening before. As always, Amoldovar tells his tale skilfully, although the power of the narrative is weakened by the decision to start near the end and reveal most of the story in flashback. And although the story ends on a note of emotional closure, I didn't find the film as involving as I might have done: the events are shown as a puzzle to be deciphered, rather than from an internal perspective. The film is certainly watchable, but adds up to less than the sum of its parts."
" El Hitchcock
",2019-09-29 00:00:00,6,"Not Almodovar's finest, but an entertaining Hitchcock melodrama. A la Vertigo and Rebecca, this is a swirling family melodrama. Full of flashbacks, jarring plot twists and a Herrmannesque score.This is a story of a family coming apart. There is guilt, misunderstanding and betrayal. Almodovar tackles it with his calling card flamboyance, using plenty of strident red in the colour palette."
" The worst of Almodovar
",2019-05-16 00:00:00,6,There is a great expectation during the whole film. Just to disapoint you very near the end.
" Two halves, intertwined.
",2019-01-18 00:00:00,7,"'Julieta (2016)', essentially, plays out like a cinematic telenovela (slight oxymoron, aside). It focuses upon a woman who's life returns to the broken waiting-game it once was when she hears of her long-lost daughter during a chance encounter with an old acquaintance. The bulk of the plot actually involves our protagonist writing down her 'dark' past in an effort to explain it properly to her daughter upon their possible reunion, with this journal being portrayed as flashbacks that take up a majority of the flick's run-time. Its strange structure makes for a story that's often told alongside - or, sometimes, instead of - being shown. It does feel a bit odd when the protagonist tells her off-screen kid about things that the kid personally did, clearly just for the sake of the audience. Still, most of the picture is interesting and, even, engaging, despite its flaws. It draws you in pretty quickly thanks to its more-than-competent construction and solid performances. There's not all that much to the piece, however. It basically ends as soon as it gets going and its revelations aren't as devastating as its oddly enigmatic soundtrack would have you believe. Having said that, the movie isn't really about what might happen once its credits have rolled - even if it seems to promise that incredibly early on. It's more of a two-hander that looks at the early life of its lead and the effect that her daughter's disappearance had on her. The latter isn't really given enough attention, especially as it feels like it's supposed to be the focus of the film (since this is where the 'juiciest' themes are), and this means that the former doesn't feel justified enough. The 'current day' stuff is too beefy to just be a framing device but the flashback bits seem like they almost want to be the main narrative, yet feel more like an extended side-plot with fairly little pay-off. It's like there were two possible interpretations of the film that quite never got decided between during production. Like I said, though, the affair is a relatively compelling one that doesn't drag and is never boring. It's entertaining in its own right, even if it ultimately doesn't feel all that deep and has a few key issues. In the end, it's a solid effort. 7/10"
" Amazing!
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,9,Top class actors and...yes - Pedro A. My pleasure !!!
" More to it than meets the eye
",2018-10-20 00:00:00,8,"Julieta - Pedro Almodovar at his thoughtful best. Julieta is overcome by grief over the apparent estrangement of her daughter. As is usually the case with Almodovar, there is more to it than meets the eye. Cue Almodovarian flashbacks. Superbly acted and thoroughly engaging and thought provoking. A great Hitchcockian musical score to boot. 8 out of ten."
" Almadovar will not surprise
",2018-10-07 00:00:00,2,Well as he started his career bold and edgy doing fetish movies and got famous by shocking people then moved to dramatic life of real spanish people with a touch of lgbt people. I think his highlight was Volver where the story dialogs characters and screenplay was connected then he went mad with banderas the skin you live in now this one is a bad joke noone would watch this if it was not almadovar there are lots of dialogs does not even make sense after a while it was more a comedy than drama and ending is well there is no ending

" Enjoyable Almodovar
",2018-03-29 00:00:00,7,"Based on three short stories in ""Runaway"" by Alice Munro: the title character is a resident of Madrid who is suddenly re-stimulated by the pain of having been estranged by her young adult daughter many years ago. In flashback, the viewer is brought to an earlier time when Julieta meets her daughter's father and the events that happened later. In the current time, Julieta is played by Emma Suarez; in the earlier flashbacks, she is played by Adriana Ugarte.As directed by Pedro Almodovar, this movie is touching in ways that are mysterious, sensuous, and passionate. It pays off like so many other beautiful and exotic European films of the past. With beautiful locations that include Madrid, the Galician coast, and the Pyrenees countryside (and lifestyles of people who end up in places like Portugal, Switzerland, Lake Como, and Milan), the movie allows us non-Europeans to temporarily live vicariously through characters with such good fortune - even if their lives are sad in other ways.By the end, there are some loose ends that are mainly due to some one-dimensional villains whose motives remain unexplained. They include a busybody, mean-spirited housekeeper and an unethical leader of a ""spiritual"" retreat centre. However, the bigger stories feel complete by the end, leaving ""Julieta"" a very fulfilling experience. Suarez's performance in this movie is definitely an asset."
" The Missing Daughter
",2018-02-18 00:00:00,7,"In Madrid, the middle-aged Julieta (Emma Suárez) is packing her books to move to Portugal with her boyfriend Lorenzo (Dario Grandinetti). She goes shopping for the journey and stumbles upon Bea (Michelle Jenner), who was the best friend of her missing daughter Antia. They talk to each other and Bea discloses that Antia is married with three children. Julieta decides to stay in Madrid; breaks with Lorenzo; and rents an apartment in her former building, hoping that Antia contacts her. She decides to write the heartbreaking story of her life since she was a young woman and met her beloved future husband and Antia´s father Xoan (Daniel Grao) until the losses of Xoan and Antia. ""Julieta"" is a dramatic romance by Pedro Almodóvar in a conventional style totally different from most of his previous works, since it is neither tacky nor aggressive to the Catholic Church; and using neither bright colors nor bizarre characters. Indeed it is a mature work disclosing the story of a middle-aged depressed woman that has her life affected for the loss of her beloved husband first and the last twelve years for the disappearance of her eighteen year-old daughter. The most important, the powerful drama never becomes a melodramatic soap-opera. The screenplay is very well-written with a perfect open end and magnificent cast. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Julieta"""
" your life and your grief are worth what happens
",2018-02-05 00:00:00,10,"If you've seen any of Pedro Almodóvar's movies, then you should know that he often focuses on relationships, especially relationships among women. ""All About My Mother"", ""Talk to Her"" and ""Volver"" are among the starkest examples. Now he brings us ""Julieta"", focusing on a mother's guilt.The title character is a middle-aged woman planning to leave Madrid. Then she comes across her daughter's best friend, bringing back a series of unpleasant memories. Julieta suffered some of the worst tragedies earlier in her life but kept pushing forward, and this meeting prompts her to change her plans.As he tends to do in his movies, Almodóvar creates some of the most complex characters. Indeed, his female characters are the most complex of all (contrast that with Michael Bay's movies, where the women are just eye candy). But these damage caused by the previous events in Julieta's life will not go away so easily, and she does what she has to.Outstanding movie."
" A pleasant Drama
",2018-01-28 00:00:00,8,"It's true, Julieta is Almodóvar's least hysterical movie. The most atypical. The post-punk look is just anecdotal and its characters are not the heroines to which we are used to.
It is a narratively mature drama, harmonious, with an air of Greek tragedy and terrible myth that goes through the film.
It is about weak women, fragile women, broken women.
The melancholic light and Hopper's colour palette create a very suitable scenario where this family drama unfolds. The movie keeps a very determined narrative tone and is a very enjoyable aesthetic experience.
The loneliness and the pain caused by the passage of time are the real main characters of the film. The depression and the unbearable guilt as well. And the spleen of the Atlantic. And the emptiness."

" need to see Antia
",2017-11-24 00:00:00,6,"Julieta is a troubled woman living in Madrid with boyfriend Lorenzo. They are moving when she runs into Bea, former best friend of her daughter Antia. Bea tells her about running into Anita and her three children. It's been 12 years since Anita ran away and Julieta has never met her own grandchildren. Julieta moves back into her old apartment hoping Antia would contact her. She starts writing a letter recounting her life starting with meeting Anita's father Xoan. There is Xoan's artist friend Ava. Julieta's parents have marital issues. An incident sets Anita off with a radically changed personality.Am I the only who wanted and expected to see adult Antia and her three kids? It seems like the movie is missing its third act. It talks about Antia's change but it doesn't confront it. Often, it's other people talking about her change. It needs the big reunion scene. It needs to be more explicit about her issues and her suspicions about her mother. There are loads of stuff left on the table. I'm assuming that Pedro Almodóvar is making the movie about Julieta but I'm just as interested in Antia. This is a nice character piece but I want more. Maybe he'll make Antia next. That would make for a nice double feature."
" Beautifully Done
",2017-08-22 00:00:00,8,"The story is not unique, but the way it was told and unfolded, coupled with the superb performance and the aesthetic visuals, all together they created a wonderful piece of cinema.The real intriguing point that was never addressed or shown throughout the film, but is the main driving force behind the whole story is the pain of losing a father from the daughter. We only see the pain of losing a husband from the mother and her suffering for losing a daughter. And again, there was no showing of the daughter's suffering with the lost of her own son (which only briefly mentioned in a letter).The title of the movie should be something else that more alluring and interesting than what it is. It would help much more with the international audiences and create more interest than just ""Julieta"", which is a very plain and ordinary name without a clue about the story."
" Post-card of himself
",2017-05-19 00:00:00,4,"Julieta is definitely not the best, but for sure not the worst of Almodovar either. It's a good story, with very good actors, good characters but the scenes Almodovar put all together are stereotypes of his own cinema and his own world. It's a bit like Tarantino who exaggerates what he does (or did) the best. Is it because he gets older and older ? Is it because he lacks inspiration ? I loved his cinema, I don't want to lash out at him but this film is not enough to resuscitate Almodovar's genius. Almodovar masters the dramatic art, the seriousness of scenes, the desire on screen but he mainly made a postcard of his own, a postcard of his own world. The salad bowl is beautiful, full of fresh vegetables and Spanish specialties, the house on the North coast features an outstanding view over the sea, the Spanish village in the south is authentic and calm, the kitchen's wall paper reminds the eighties but it is mainly ""beautifully cheesy"". It requires no effort to watch it, you can let you drive by his eternal love towards Madrid, the women, the Spanish country side, sexual desires and you can lie to yourself saying it's agreat one... it may work for some time and you'll have a good moment. The end of the film is just a non-ending story... and we (his fans) will wait for the next one."
" Wonderful cinematography, weak script
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,6,"It's usually worth watching an Almodovar movie if only for the exquisite use he makes of the camera and the quality of acting he manages to extract from his cast. That is certainly the case with Julieta in which every scene is beautifully composed. Andalusia, Galicia and Madrid have never looked so enticing. Having said that, the narrative of this movie is really poor. It revolves in some sense around the theme of guilt but that doesn't stand up well to a close examination. The twist at the close is pure melodrama and the film doesn't really end at all. Almodovar just brings down the shutters on the movie. So this is very much a mixed bag. Lovely filming, lovely actors, lovely decor, but dare I say it, this is basically an art-house soap."
" Quiet
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,8,"At first glance, a writer like Alice Munro is a very odd choice for Almodovar. I can't think of an artist less like the Spanish director. Her quiet, restrained and disciplined writing is the polar opposite of the man who gave us Todo sobre mi madre. Yet it works, because Almodovar is seeking a more profound way of communication, without the glamour and tawdriness he came to prominence with.Emma Suarez is very effective here; she reminds me of Annette Bening at her best. Adriana Ugarte is less accomplished, relying on a fetching smile to make her points. The other actors give good support. I liked Daniel Grao as the fisherman who wins Julieta's heart."
" Fate and mother/daughter relationships
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,10,"Fate and mother/daughter relationships Pedro Almodóvar crowns his 30 year career as one of our most creative, controversial and brilliant cinematic artists with this his twentieth film – JULIETA – based on three short stories by Alice Munro as adapted for the screen by Almodóvar. Not only is the story mesmerizing and at times challenging to keep up with the director's ideas, it displays a brilliant cast of Spanish actors in one of the most impressive films of the past year. One of the tricky directorial decisions is to employ two actresses to play the same character – one as the younger Julieta and one as the more mature Julieta. The manner in which Almodóvar transitions these two aspects of the personality of Julieta (as well as the stunning performances by the two actresses – Emma Suárez and Adriana Ugarte) is just one of the miracles of this film.Briefly, after a casual encounter, a brokenhearted woman decides to confront her life and the most important events about her stranded daughter. But more specifically, Julieta (Emma Suárez) is a middle-aged woman living in Madrid with her boyfriend Lorenzo (Dario Grandinetti). They plan to move to Portugal when Julieta encounters Bea (Michelle Jenner), former best friend of her daughter Antia (Priscilla Delgado then Blanca Parés), who reveals that Antia is living in Switzerland and is married and with three children. With the heart broken after 12 years of total absence of her daughter, Julieta cancels the journey to Portugal and she moves to her former building, in the hope that Antia someday communicates with her sending a letter. Alone with her thoughts, Julieta starts to write her memories to confront the pain of the events happened when she was a teenager (Adriana Ugarte) and met Xoan (Daniel Grao), a Galician fisherman. Falling in love with him, Julieta divides her time between the family, the job and the education of Antia until a fatal accident changes their lives: Xoan is drowned at sea during a brutal storm. Slowly decaying in a depression, Julieta is helped by Antia and Bea, but one day Antia goes missing suddenly after a vacation with no clues about where to find her, leaving Julieta desperate to understand the reasons of her missing and her search leads to self discovery and acceptance of buried secrets – her own relationship with her mother and the kinship between like mother who happen to be mother/daughter. The uniformly excellent cast includes the Almodóvar constant, Rossy de Palma, whose presence is a meaningful driver to the story. The musical score is by Alberto Iglesas and the lush cinematography is the work of Jean-Claude Larrieu. But the crown belongs to Pedro Almodóvar – another brilliant masterpiece."
" Julieta is superb
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,8,Julieta is another great story telling film by Almodovar. There is always something in the story that you are curious to find out while watching. Each frame is colorful which I think is a signature of Almodovar and that is an eye pleasure. Actors are good. It is a very good drama.
" The film belongs to Alice Munro
",2017-03-09 00:00:00,8,"Before the end credits rolled out, my feeling was ""At last a great film from Almodovar with a mesmerizing performance from Emma Suarez as the older Julieta."" That feeling, unfortunately, was short lived.Almodovar had not written the story--many of his other works are his own. Almodovar had merely adapted the stories of Nobel Prize winning Canadian author Alice Munro. I have never read Munro to date but the depth of the story line urges me to do so fast. She is great!The film is also memorable for Emma Suarez' screen presence as the older Julieta. So were the choice of the music and the paintings used in the film.This is for me the most likable Almodovar film and yet it does not belong to him: it belongs to the Canadian lady. One got the feeling you were watching the filmed version of a modern day Dostoyevsky without the religion and Russian connections. Anyway thanks to you Mr Almodovar for your decision to make this film as also to Ms Sarah Polley for making ""Away from Her,"" some 10 years ago, another film that used the writings of Ms. Munro."
" Love and death alienate mother and daughter
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,10,"In the first scene Julieta packs in bubble wrap a clay-brown sculpture, which becomes perhaps the film's key symbol. As we later learn, it's a bronze sculpture by Ava, the artist friend of Julieta's first love Xoan. This very modern abstraction of a seated male is marked by three inflections. The penis rampant is abruptly truncated exposing a hole. A Lynn Chadwick-style triangle replaces the head, rendering the human into an abstraction. It emphasizes the rational and impersonal. The terracotta surface makes the figure seem pre-Colombian and light. But despite the clay colour Ava has cast her human figure in bronze to protect it from blowing away. The first of those two details summarize the central romantic relationship. When Julieta first meets and makes love to Xoan he has a comatose wife. When Julieta comes to him the wife has just died, so their new romance flourishes. But the triangle persists. Xoan still has occasional sex with his longtime friend Ava. As Julieta's last lover, Lorenzo, is also Ava's friend she can't escape the triangular relationship. That sculpture adorns the cover of Lorenzo's book. The heavy bronze painted as flesh-like clay encapsulates Almodovar's sense of the human condition here. Clay is the source of the flesh, soft, vulnerable to the elements, especially to the wind. To survive, it needs an additional core of strength and substance. While the metallic is conventionally the emblem of a non-feeling, unemotional character, here the core that enables individuals and relationships to survive is the capacity to love and to remain committed across years of separation and misunderstanding. Thus Xoan maintains an integral commitment to both Ava and Julieta, as her father does to his helpless wife and to the girl hired to care for her. Lorenzo remains in love with Julieta despite her rejection when she decides to stay in Madrid to try to find her daughter Antia, after a 12-year alienation.Julieta's three men form a non-romantic triangle. Xoan and her father form her base: heavy muscular men with beards and a commitment to life in the elements, her fathering choosing to become a farmer and Xoan already a fisherman. In contrast Lorenzo is cerebral, academic, bald, in her maturity a refuge from her earlier men. The train passenger whose suicide haunts Julieta has the academic mien of Lorenzo and the hirsute force of Xoan and her father. The stranger has the other three men's loneliness but having failed to find their loving connection takes the train —with empty luggage — to kill himself. The other men survive their losses because they have the bronze core of love given and received. The suicide is like empty fragile clay.Yet the film escapes any feeling of abstract schema. Xoan dies in wind and water. He storms off to fish when Julieta confronts him with his affair with Ava. That is, one's emotional life may give one the stability and purpose with which to survive. But even it cannot ward off the accidents and cruelties of fate that the flesh is air to. Xoan is broken into pieces by the wind and water but Julieta identifies him by his tattoo with her and their Antia's initials. His death, like his love, brings Julieta and Ava together. They jointly pour Xoan's ashes back into the sea. The film's most enigmatic figure is Antia. We watch her from infancy into maturity but we share Julieta's loss of connection when she goes off to her spiritual retreat. When she learns what drove her father off to the storm she blames her mother and Ava for his death. Then she blames herself for having been enjoying herself at the summer camp when he died. The bronze in this human figure is the oppressive lead of guilt, which all three women have to work to transcend. On this point the clay is the constructive reminder of human vulnerability, helplessness, especially in the twisting fortunes of love. Before Antia turns against her mother she turns against her first best friend Bea. This new friendship keeps Antia at camp and takes her to her friend's home in Madrid, prolonging the period before she learns of her father's death. Antia makes Julieta move to Madrid to be closer to Bea. But Antia's friendship/love eventually grows so oppressive Bea flees her to America. That's when Anita breaks their friendship and goes to the retreat.Despite her anger Antia keeps some connection to her mother, sending a few fanciful birthday cards. For her part, Julieta marks her daughter's birthday by dumping a birthday cake into the trash three years running. Only when she has married, had three children and lost the oldest to drowning does Antia experience what her mother suffered when Xoan died. That loss, that discovery of her own vulnerability, gives Antia the strengthened core to write her mother and provide her own address, tacitly inviting the imminent visit that ends the film."
" A study in loss and grief with the gloss of an exceptional aesthetic
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,7,"One of the best things about seeing the latest Almodóvar movie is being immersed in a world that is not America. The scenery, the characters, the daily life and overall traditions are from the director's Spanish realm. After several decades of his movies, we anticipate what he's going to present us next, for it will be something that holds our attention and makes us laugh or think. Above all, it will be the latest unveiling of an artist's work.Music plays a dominant role in Julieta, composed by Alberto Iglesias, a familiar collaborator of Almodóvar. The tone and atmosphere of the music as the movie opens set the stage for the coming content, and it's dark, almost haunting, and subtly ominous. Its predominant characteristic expresses the dead feeling of depression. It always stays just below the line where life percolates, and over the course of the story at key moments rises just enough to deliver suspense but still remains under that non-living line. Without the music's role in the story arc, the tale's simplicity and the camera's slow study of Julieta's state of mind might have resulted in a dull film, for as Orson Welles once said: ""Films should be able to tell you a story quicker than any other medium."" But Julieta succeeds in its objective of studying a woman's loss, and loss is not something easily captured in words. The visual portrayal of loss has more power, and Emma Suárez, who plays the middle-aged Julieta, holds us still in our witnessing of her static grief, which is depression. Julieta is loosely based on three short stories by the Canadian Nobel Prize–winner Alice Munro. The stories have been moved to a Spanish milieu and processed through the imagination of Spain's greatest filmmaker. The opening music shares the screen with sensual red folds of fabric that then wrap a contemporary sculpture of a terracotta man with an over-sized pipe for a penis. An important blue envelope is thrown into the trash. We come to understand that Julieta is moving, packing and throwing out, cutting ties to her past. Her boyfriend, an art critic Lorenzo, arrives and their brief conversation tells us they are a happy couple moving to Portugal. In the next scene, Julieta encounters Bea, her daughter Antía's closest childhood friend, and learns that Antía lives in Como. We witness Julieta's stunned and ravaged face as she grasps onto this news of her daughter, and from that moment on, the movie delves into the past and how Julieta lost contact with Antía. She ends her plans to move to Portugal with Lorenzo. She rents an available apartment in the same building where she and Antía once lived on the off chance that Antía will try to reach her after thirteen years. She sits down, opens a large notebook, and begins writing to Antía the story of what happened to them. This narrative becomes the story of the movie, with Adriana Ugarte playing the younger, bombshell Julieta.Colors mark the movie, deep saturated colors that deliver mystery and mood, or flamboyant colors like young Julieta's shock of bleached hair and her bright facial make-up and clothing. We're treated to idyllic seaside views of her lover Xoan's home—he's a hunky Galician fisherman played by Daniel Grao. The terra-cotta figure with pipe penis seems to symbolize him, for the hottest passion imaginable strikes these two characters at the beginning of Julieta's memoir to Antía, and results in Antía's conception and the future of the family. Just the way the music is almost ominous, almost sinister, Xoan's housekeeper Maria (Inma Cuesta) fills us with uneasiness—is she good or bad? Her face when dealing with Julieta is cold and inscrutable, possibly plotting evil, but later with the teenage Antía, she shows her warmth and affection. This kind of suspense in character and music keeps us waiting for something to happen, and though something does, a tragedy, a loss, it's not violent or visually traumatic. It's depression.The movie successfully explores depression caused by tragedy and loss. Perhaps the ambivalence an audience might feel when the movie ends has to do with not really feeling close to Julieta or Antía, despite comprehending their interior worlds through their facial and physical communication. We remain on the objective, viewing side of a situation, our minds involved but not our hearts, as if the work is a study. It's an incongruity in the movie that Xoan's home and Julieta's Madrid apartments are upper middle class in furnishings and possessions. She comes from a teacher's background and Xoan is a fisherman, but their lifestyle, and her outfits, couldn't be more bourgeois. Those furnishings for the characters stand out and remove the viewer from the willing suspension of disbelief. For Almodóvar fans, Julieta will be worth seeing as the latest from an artist's oeuvre, but it won't be as powerful as Bad Education (about Catholic-priest sex abuse) or Talk to Her (about friendship and love), or even, for those who can take it, the macabre thriller The Skin I Live In."
" The Odyssey of Julieta
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,8,"In his late 60s, Almodovar has composed a moving saga about a woman's journey through life. At first sight, the heroine of his new film 'Julieta' is an attractive academic preparing for a quiet retirement, but it's soon revealed her daughter Antia has been missing for more than a decade. Julieta's plans change after a chance encounter with her daughter's former BFF, who tells of glimpsing Antia in Italy. Julieta reacts to this news by shelving her retirement plans and moving back to her old apartment building in Madrid. Julieta starts writing a memoir, and the film follows this account, beginning with Julieta as a young teacher of classical literature and mythology. She meets Antia's fisherman father, and after her daughter is conceived, Julieta moves into the man's home on the coast. As the years pass, Julieta fails to notice some important changes in Antia prior to the girl's mysterious disappearance. The different passages of Julieta's life resemble Ulysses' diverse adventures in The Odyssey, as random currents toss her around like a cork in the ocean. When Julieta's memoir brings her back to present-day Madrid, order emerges from apparent chaos and understanding arrives. The resolution of her story turns out to be as satisfying and thought-provoking as a myth."
" ""We get what we deserve . . . ""
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,7,". . . notes JULIETA's daughter Antia to her mom during this offering from that knotty director, Pedro Almodovar. It seems as if almost every character in this Spanish drama has gotten paralyzed by a stroke or general catatonia, if they haven't contracted Lou Gehrig's Disease or multiple sclerosis, unless they were fortunate enough to drown, get run over by a train, or hit by a bus first. What have the Spanish DONE to merit so much Bad Karma? Students of history will remember that when this nation had a chance to choose between Hitler's Jew-burning Nazi Storm Troopers or the Union Normal People Blue Collar faction championed so poignantly by Ernest Hemingway in FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS, the Spanish Electoral College put Hitler's puppet Franco into power for decades to come. (IS Franco still dead? This was a major mystery dragging on for months if not years in 20th Century Spain.) Just as the Americans still have not been able to purge the Deplorable Confederate Spermatozoa from their Gene Pool, Spain still is grappling with Franco's spawn, as Almodovar's Antia observes. (But what WAS is that empty briefcase left on the train??)"
" Interesting film ruined by a lack of resolution
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,5,"""Julieta"": The Ending DisappointsSPOILER! It's not that the ending to ""Julieta"" is ambiguous, as in ""Inception"" or ""Bladerunner."" And it's not that the climax occurred and we still don't know what's going to happen with the main character, whether the antagonist in ""No Country for Old Men"" or the protagonists in ""The Graduate."" The problem with ""Julieta"" is that Almodóvar sets up a climax and the film ends before we get there. It not only lacks a climax or ending, the film is an anti-climax. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YH5_4osOZK8It's a beautiful film and the dialogue is terse and dynamic. The set up is interesting and mysterious. We can't wait to see what happens when Julieta meets her estranged daughter who disappeared years earlier. Just as Julieta is driving to see her daughter at the address her daughter had mailed her, we see the ending title on the screen: JULIETA. You suck, Pedro Almodóvar, you suck big time! This anti-climax is a major fail and makes what was a good film into a terrible film. Did the director run out of ideas? Was it writer's block? Did he run out of funding or time? Or, what I believe, he's too clever for his film's good and decided to leave it. Whatever the reason, the lack of resolution to ""Julieta"" damages the movie beyond repair. The film didn't need to resolve itself, it needed to end in a way that was acceptable. Instead, her lover reads the last line of the film, not Julieta stating something enigmatic. The film is called Julieta, and she doesn't even have the last line. Sad. Rating: Rent it. It looks good and the dialogue is great. Just remember, you can turn it off anytime, since it won't get to an ending. Peace, Tex Shelters"
" Portrait of a mother-daughter relationship gone awry
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,7,"""Julieta' (2016 release from Spain; 96 min.) brings the story of the title character. As the movie opens, we see Julieta boxing up her books. We learn that Julieta and her boyfriend Lorenzo are planning to move from Madrid to Portugal. Later by happenstance Julieta runs into Bea on the street, a childhood friend of Antia, Julieta's daughter. Julieta is astonished to hear from Bea that Antia has 3 kids now, and we learn that Juleta in fact is completely estranged from Antia. Hearing this news shocks Julieta and she decides to stay in Madrid, and move back into the building where she raised Antia. Julieta starts a long letter to Antia, and in a flashback we go back in time to where it all began for Julieta. At this point we're 10 min. into the movie. What is it that drove Antia apart from Julieta? To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest from writer-director Pedro Almodóvar (the opening credits show it as simply ""un film de Almodóvar--never mind that there are two Almodóvars: this Pedro, and his brother Agustin). Pedro has had a lot of ups and downs in his illustrious career, although really more ups than downs (and winning two Oscars along the way). Here he adapts several short stories from Canadian author Alice Munro to bring a complex portrait of a woman struggling mightily with being estranged by her own daughter. The movie plays out in 2 levels: the present (where Julieta is played by Emma Suarz, and the past, where the younger Julia is played by Adriana Ugarte). Almodóvar keeps moving the story forward at a nice clip but never rushes. There are several outstanding scenes. The train sequence near the beginning reminded me of Hitchcock, no kidding. But ultimately this is a movie about guilt (how to create it and how to deal with it) and a sense of doubt. Kudos to the two lead actresses for this multi-layered portrayal.""Julieta"" opened to great acclaim at last year's Cannes Film Festival, and I couldn't wait to see it. It finally opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great (maybe 10 people in total). That is a darn shame. If you are in the mood for a quality foreign movie that brings a rich and nuanced portrait about a mother-daughter relationship gone awry, you cannot go wrong with this, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Julieta"" is a WINNER."
" Well-acted, but screenplay a disappointment
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,6,"An Almodovar fan for decades, I couldn't wait to see his newest film after recently seeing a trailer for it while viewing Paul Verhoeven's newest, ""Elle,"" with Isabelle Huppert: I drove 75 miles to see ""Julieta"" in the only city it was playing near me currently. The theater was packed and you could feel the anticipation as the lights went down, but, as the film progressed, my, my friend's, and many audience members' enjoyment of the evening started to flag. On the positive side, Almodovar and his Director of Photography (and set and costume designers) deliver a typical-for-Almodovar beautiful-to-look-at film, filled with primary colors and interesting locales, and the film is very well-acted by all involved, but as the screenplay unfolds it becomes obvious this is one of Almodovar's lesser efforts--the melodrama not as intense or surprising (or fun) as in many of his past films, and the ending one of the most unsatisfying in memory (of any film). There was some applause at the end, but it was limp and scattered--most audience members obviously thought the film just O.K. or worse. If you're a fan, it's worth seeing, as you'll appreciate his cast and the acting (and the look of the film), as I did, but if you don't know who Almodovar is or you're looking for a great film, ""Julieta"" isn't it."
" Almodovar excellence
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,8,"Greetings again from the darkness. Pedro Almodovar is a fascinating filmmaker and one that I've followed consistently since his 1988 Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown. Over that almost 30 year period, I have rarely felt let down by his work, and have quite often walked out of the theatre in awe of his artistry, creativity and dedication to providing original cinematic viewing experiences.The quite visually suggestive opening sets the stage for an Almodovar experience, only what follows is much different than what we have come to expect. It's (somewhat) based on the short story trilogy of Alice Munro (Destino, Pronto, Silencio), and returns him again to his strength – telling the story of women. It may not be as flamboyant as some of his previous work, but rather it's a pure and earnest emotional drama. It even has a bit of Hitchcockian flavor with the element of mystery playing a central role.Emma Suarez and Adrian Ugarte alternate in the role of Julieta and both are excellent. Ms. Suarez plays the older Julieta looking back on her life, while Ms. Ugarte populates most of the memories being entered into the journal  a writing effort designed to fill in the life gaps for her long estranged daughter Antia.We learn that Julieta fell in love with fisherman Xoan (Daniel Grao) while his wife was in a coma, and that Antia was conceived before the wife passed away. Xoan's housekeeper Marian (played brilliantly by Almodovar regular Rossy de Palma) is one who knows a man has needs, but doesn't always know when to speak and when to remain silent. One of her not so secret secrets is Xoan's artist friend Ava (Imma Cuesta) who manages to get close to Xoan, Julieta and Antia. Ava is such an interesting character that a movie about her could have been equally entertaining. Other key players here are the older Julieta's boyfriend Lorenzo (another Almodovar regular Dario Grandinetti) and Antia's special childhood friend Bea (Sara Jimenez) who appears years later (as Michelle Jenner) in a quick appearance that rocks Julieta's world.Guilt, death, love, disappointment, and relationships are all significant pieces to this Almodovar puzzle. Spirituality even pops up when Antia attends a retreat and makes her life-altering decision  one spurred by youth and vulnerability, and possibly leading to regret later in life. As Julieta recounts her life, we understand her middle-aged whole in the heart. She has ""lost"" everyone she has ever loved – her husband, her daughter, her mother.Cinematographer Jean-Claude Larrieu experiments with camera angles and captures the beautiful vistas and landscapes, while never losing the intimacy required for such an emotional journey. The color red is all over the film and almost jumps off the screen at times, ensuring that the visual element never is far removed from the drama. The score from Alberto Iglesias is excellent and quite a complement to another master work from Almodovar."
" Pedro's Best?
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,10,"Almodovar is one of the top 10 directors of all time. As a storyteller, he commands his camera, giving us beautiful films both in their content, their performances, and he always makes sure the mix is perfect, never letting his fantastic use of technology and aesthetics overpower the stories or the performances. In ""Julieta"" he goes a step further, taking on three different stories, adapting them and giving us the story of two characters, two women who are related and hardly know each other, always subjected to fate's cruel turns.At the beginning, a casual encounter between two friends gets the older Julieta return to a part of her life she had chosen to bury. Soon, she says goodbye to what seems to be a good relationship and begins to write her memoirs, which takes us back to the origins of the different tragedies in her life.She is writing the book for the missing daughter, clarifying events she never fully explained to her. It appears there's no hope for them ever getting back together, which the movie a sad tone from the start. There's romance, mystery, regret, and it all is overshadow by the broken relationship; something that appears to have no solution.The young Julieta is full of life, but there's something she fears, and we soon find out what it is. Her story is not that of a regular woman. She meets the man of her life, marries him, and has a daughter. A decade goes by, and this is when her life takes an unexpected turn. Following the death of her husband, she moves to Madrid to start again.Many years go by, things apparently going well, until she's separated from her daughter under mysterious circumstances. All communications between end, except for a birthday ritual which only adds to Julieta's misery. Eventually, everything is revealed, and we understand why their relationship changed.Almodovar knows and understands women. They're strong, vulnerable, complex, and full characters. He hasn't changed his approach here, and all the actors give him wonderful performances. It is also clear that he will continue writing and directing movies that matter and show humans strengths and faults."
