" Phenomenal
",2021-03-13 00:00:00,9,One of the best mystery thriller seen in my life bacchan Saab rocks the show. I don't know how it is a commercial failure even it has strong story. Overall a excellent movie and only thing I didn't liked is ending. Apart from that it was a excellent movie.
" LOVED THIS MOVIE, UNTIL . . .
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,6,". . . the plot hole at the end that Hannibal could have used to lead his army through as he went over the Alps.The one grandpa was framed for BOTH kidnappings and only the one murder, because grandson Ronnie was safely taken back to mom and dad by the priest.Apparently, Ronnie was incapable of ever mentioning to anyone that his kidnapper wasn't grandpa, and he'd enjoyed his time with John uncle. I guess kids don't testify in court, police don't follow up, and parents reunited with kidnapped children don't cry over how horrible it is to be taken by their own family.""Why is grandpa in jail""?
""Because he kidnapped you"".
""No he didn't, John uncle took me to play football, and when the priest showed up, they talked for a while, then he brought me home. I had so much fun"".
""Silly boy, you're confused""."
" A very complex mystery
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,7,"The plot is slow and complex; however, it is entertaining and manages to capture the viewer's attention."
" Good movie as a remake
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,6,"Mastercopy of Korean ""montage""
Well though it's a remake version, the cast and crew did a good job..
I specially liked the movie for nawazuddin siddique"
" Good enough
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,7,"I watch mostly International films and series, with favorites being Indian and South Korean. So I'm a bit biased toward them, but I'm rarely disappointed either. This one works just fine because of always wonderful Amitabh Bachchan and his supporting cast. It's a bit predictable but still interesting with just the right edge of suspense and satisfying resolution. The music is also good with some effective touches in the second half. I enjoyed this one for a Saturday afternoon break."
" Almost nailed it
",2020-12-15 00:00:00,8,"It's a mystery thriller, though not at par with Kahaani (with which it shares much of its cast), still effective to an extent. It was long after the movie was over I realised why it is named Te3n - there are three timelines progressing simultaneously throughout the film!"
" Thriller
",2020-09-14 00:00:00,10,"Amazing plot twists
Powerful characters
Heart touching
Depressing
This movie has it all ðŸ”¥"
" Phenomenal Thriller
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,9,"This is an absolutely awesome thriller movie. It will keep you hooked up till the end. Performances as one expects from Amitabh Bachchan, Nawazuddin Sidiqui and Vidya Balan are amazing. Makers did a great job. The way suspense is build up and the way it unfolds is superb. I loved watching this movie and I definitely recommend this to everyone."
" Very good story
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,10,One of the finest crime thriller movie ever. Great performance by Amitap Bachan. Each shots were so realistic.
" Could have been better!
",2019-05-27 00:00:00,5,"After Kahani, one expected Sujoy Ghosh to deliver another thriller/mystery. But Te3n was hugely disappointing. Acting wise Amitabh puts a commendable performance, but the rest of the star cast were subdued and subjected to monologues. The story had great potential. The screenplay was crisp. The tone was deep and right from the start the viewers are thrown into the thick of the mystery. But somewhere the characterization was not fleshed out. Nawazuddin and Vidya had not much to do and it was left to Amitabh to shoulder the story. What was the real motive behind Sabyasachi's kidnapping crime, the reason was not too serious. No one will kidnap and ask for ransom in the pretext of taking care of the medical needs of a loved one. One must have a strong and compelling reason that gravitates the viewers to either feel for or against the character. How does Amitabh conveniently finds Sabyasachi's crime? How and why does he refuse police help? What's the role of Vidya when Nawazuddin is there? Why did Nawazuddin drop the case and decides to become a father? So many questions that I felt could have been said but missed. Overall an average thriller."
" Must watch film. You will love Amitabh acting
",2019-05-12 00:00:00,10,Amitabh acting is awesome. One of the best movie of amitabh's. He has so much of passion about acting. I loved it..
" Predictable, horrible ending with lots of plot holes
",2019-04-01 00:00:00,4,"A slow paced movie with a very predictable mystery. Most of the audience could solve the mystery before the interval. Most of the supporting actors (specially the parents) delivered horrible performances. Also, I found the ending morally wrong."
" Good Movie! {criti-cally reviews}
",2019-02-01 00:00:00,8,"My ExpectationIt was supposed to be a thriller, and having read the reviews earlier, calling it ""slow"", but praise for everyone's acting, my expectations were medium. I expected the story to be good, based on a Korean film. I expected good performances and acting from the 3 main lead characters. And I expected a relatively good narrative from the director.My ReviewThe movie matched my expectation. Though not exactly that suspenseful or cringing, the story was well narrated. It deserved its 4 stars completely.
The acting by all the main lead characters was perfect as expected. Amitabh as the old guy, Nawazuddin as the retired cop turned priest and Vidya as the inspector working on it currently.Spoiler Alert The story is about a grandfather who's grandchild was kidnapped and got killed in the process of saving her. How he plans on catching the kidnapper by weaving this enormous repeat scene of the kidnapping, for the actual kidnapper's grandchild this time. The perfect revenge. Spoiler End
The story is very well narrated and I wouldn't call its pace slow. The director captures the city, creates a story with the little he has and develops his characters toying with the audience's emotions and giving them that feel of ""I understand"" or ""I would have probably done the same"" kind of feel.5 stars could have been earned if the story was little more wild. The whole thing is woven like something very awful happened, but it at the end, it wasn't truly that horrible. The audience came to be leaving the theatre shaken, but they are not. The villain was shown weak, his acting wasn't good, many times it seemed he was faking. Some scenes were unnecessary and some things portrayed seemed fake, such as the excessive talking by Vidya and Nawazuddin (more exchange of dialogues) and less actual working on the case etc.But overall the film was a visual treat and with a good storyline portrayed beautiful. Deserving to the in anyone's movie collection and easily bags 4 stars.How It Impacted MeWell personally I don't see how it personally impacted me much, except seeing, that everyone is suffering from pain, some deeper than the other. But still overall, a sense of closeness with family and in relationships develops, such as wanting to be close to my wife in old age, having a granddaughter for my parents to play with etc, is induced from watching the movie."
" copy paste
",2019-01-27 00:00:00,7,This movie is the official remake of Korean movie montage
" Not Impressed
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,5,"The suspense was not presented well to enjoy the film. Direction was mediocre. Amitabh was disappointing while the other leads were quite good especially characters Martin and Nancy. The end could have been presented in a better way. Overall, the movie was not impressive even thought the main lead was a superstar."
" Perfect...
",2018-08-20 00:00:00,10,"The whole duration of the movie( 2hrs) i was sooo anxius to find the bad guy of the story that i really didn t understand how the time passed..
The ending is excellent,i was expected a murder maybe but even though i felt kinda reliefed...Really good!!"
" A rare bollywood thriller...with terrific acting
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,9,"First things first..didn't watch ""Montage"" korean film..on which this movie is based..and i don't want too either...let me explain why in one word...""Amitabh Bachhan""Acting was brilliant...Amit ji, Nawazuddin and Vidya Balan were awesome to watch... (vidya had less screen time unfortunately)Amitabh played a character who is devastated and sad...watching him..made me feel for the character.. made me feel sad too...it was acting at its finestNawazuddin plays a character who is disillusioned and keen to turn his life over...and is trying hard to but is lost anyway unless he finds redemptionKolkata itself becomes a character thanks to good cinematographyFor a thriller, screenplay lags a bit...but it never feels long...with emphasis on characters, mind boggling twists...clever reveals and an ending that is near perfect make this simple kidnap story...achieve a connect with the characters that is rare in this genre...Background music and songs deal about pain..and complement well with movieMust watch for Amitabh fans...A contemporary classic from director Ribhu Dasgupta"
" SPOILER - Bad remake of Montage 2013
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,1,"It is very easy to copy someones original idea and present it as your own. ""JUST AN EXACT COPY PASTE movie"". People who watched montage won't enjoy it for a bit and it definitely spoiled suspense for a lot of people.I am a big fan of Korean movies and this is not he first time Bollywood copied from Koreans so guys if you are about to watch it, just see Montage first and probably skip this MASTER COPY PASTE."
" A spooky thriller with a phenomenal performance by Amitabh Bachchan
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,6,"""Te3n"" is a thriller concerning the investigation of an old grandfather to find the kidnapper of her granddaughter who was kidnapped and killed eight years ago, after the police is unable to solve the case. The film starts somewhat slow, but as the film proceeds, the suspense deepens and the end astonishes and takes your attention from what had happened in the beginning. The suspense has a right touch and the spooky twists may be the brainchild of the Korean Film ""Montana"" on which it's based. But the genuine thing to watch in the film is the controlled and stand out performance by Amitabh Bachchan which is phenomenal. Vidya Balan and Nawazzudin Siddique also do their roles well but somewhat look weary. Overall, the film begins a bit slow and sets to its suspense soon.Rating: 2 stars out of 4"
