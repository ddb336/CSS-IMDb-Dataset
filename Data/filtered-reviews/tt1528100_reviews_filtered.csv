" Disappointing
",2021-04-09 00:00:00,2,"I mean ... I watched the whole thing just to see what other BS was inserted into this well known story. Above all, the book of Exodus is a story of God's love and mercy for His people shown through His use an imperfect man to perform His miracles. You will find none of that in this mockery of God and those of us whose faith is in Him."
" Historically and Biblically inaccurate
",2021-04-08 00:00:00,1,"Not sure who's idea it was to make this movie, but they shouldn't have. The acting is mediocre at best. Not sure what accent Christian Bale was trying to have, but it wasn't Hebrew. He was a worse Moses than he was Batman. And he wasn't a very good Batman. Having Moses commit multiple murders is totally inaccurate. Also, a child god? Obviously Ridley Scott hasn't studied history or read the book of Exodus. Preparing an army to fight goes against Moses' faith in God. The Ten Commandments movie was overacted, but at least it had some semblance to what actually occurred based on historical documents. This movie obviously was made for the action scenes and thinks faith in God isn't possible. I wouldn't recommend wasting anytime watching this poor excuse of an account of Moses. Christian bale really needs acting lessons as do many of the cast members in this debacle."
" Emotionless
",2021-04-08 00:00:00,5,"The defiant leader Moses rises up against Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses II, setting six hundred thousand slaves on a monumental journey of escape from Egypt and its terrifying cycle of deadly plagues.Before I get into this review, I want to stress on a subject first. The storyline of this movie is based on the biblical story of Moses, but it is not his story and does not reflect the story as it is in the bible. I have seen a lot of wrongly based reviews and incredibly low ratings because of this.Directing: Ridley Scott needs no introduction, but I must say that he took a noticeably big leap with this movie. I am not disappointed with his vision and the crucial changes he made to the original story because that his own vision and he has the right to do whatever he wants with it. When it comes to stories that have a deep historical and religious following one must be careful when relaying that story especially in a high budget international movie which is something Ridley did not take into consideration.Production: One thing that jumped out to me was the numerous Egyptian producers and executive producers that worked in the team to make this movie as historically realistic as possible with extensive attention to detail. With Ridley on set, I would expect nothing less than perfection. The Hiring thought was not accurate to say the least and this showed drastically throughout the movie.Script: The script plays the most important part in movies such as this one, especially when it is based on a true story and more importantly when it is referenced biblically. Extreme caution needs to be taken when writing such a script. I can't say the writers did a bad job, but what I can say is that they approached this movie as they would any other, and I suspect this was the intention of Ridely.Acting: I am not sure what happened here, Bale is a phenomenal actor, so is Sigourney and Kingsley. I must say that the acting overall was bland. Throughout the movie I felt there is something missing, I can't wrap my head around what it is exactly, but I had this constant feeling that there is something missing in their performance. I am also not fully convinced that Turturo was the best decision here to take on the role of Seti. To be honest, I didn't feel any of the main actors fit their roles except Edgerton whom I think did an amazing job as Ramses.Cinema and sound: The numerous nominations, the 140 million plus thrown at this movie should be the ""enough said"". Visually stunning, amazing sets, extreme attention to detail in everything and some of the best camera work I've seen. I would expect nothing less with Ridley on set and they deserve the praise. I especially like the score by Alberto Iglesias and felt it fit this movie very well.Conclusion: I was excited to watch this movie, but I am saddened to say that I ended up leaving disappointed. Movies such as this need to have a deep emotional connection with the viewer, and the lack of it makes it bland and only watchable for the stunning cinematography.I give Exodus: Gods and Kings a rating of 5/10."
" Not Good
",2021-03-31 00:00:00,2,"This movie made God looks like He's a horrible personality,and the Egyptian was the ""real"" victim."
" Not so much...
",2021-03-12 00:00:00,4,I thought the crazy bible people rated this movie down. It turned out I was wrong. Oh Riley mate... What the heck where you smoking...
" The bright knight barely rises!
",2021-02-18 00:00:00,3,"Outdated story, poor acting, poor screenplay and yet some good action scenes at the end.
Nothing special at all!"
" Ridley, Thank goodness you're NOT Mel GIbson
",2021-02-16 00:00:00,6,"The title by the way is in response to some joker that had the title ""Ridley, you are no Mel GIbson"". I say, thank god he's not. This may be a soulless, emotionless Hollywood play on the biblical classic text but at least its relatively faithful to the fictional text. Unlike Braveheart which was one mans grotesque indulgence into Scottish history. I should also mention that... Ridley, thank goodness you're not Mel Gibson. Can you imagine what that self appointed anti-Semite would have done to this, probably would have depicted Moses on the loosing side!!Ok, rant over, back to the film. It was ok, the effects were good, the majority of acting was fine, the direction was ok. Its a filler film, good for a Sunday afternoon with no thinking involved and a big bag of popcorn.People go crazy at films like this when they think the subject matter should be treated with respect. They're wrong. If you want respect, read the bible, its a good yarn. Full of set pieces, dramatic climaxes and over zealous writing. But be warned it has more plot holes then the film and the endings not as good.Hope that helped"
" Believe it or not, it's Ridley?
",2021-02-16 00:00:00,2,"Anyone for some Ham and Cheese? Ok, it's slightly better than 'Gods Of Egypt', but that's not hard.
Allegedly the Director's Cut is 4 hours long, perhaps all the bits that were cut out were the good bits? I would hope at least that the film makes more sense with all that extra footage. I could just tell that it has been butchered in the editing suite.Now I'm not someone who ever attended Sunday School or paid attention in Religious Education lessons if I even turned up to them, but even I have heard of Moses. However without knowing his origin story, the bit with the basket, ya know? until halfway through, I didn't realise that it was that Moses we were watching a film about.I spent most of the time on Wikipedia refreshing my memory on Mo's biblical antics and found that this film had not only missed out huge chunks, but that it had also used a lot of artistic license in its production.Starting as the cousin of Ramses II (Not the actual Pharaoh from the original novel) it does follow Mo, who is banished and confronted by ""God"" or at least a very weird child as a messenger or something, before starting a war with Ram to free the slaves. If you know the bible, it does loosely continue with what is printed there, but with those huge gaps.
Actually, if anything, it goes out of its way to disprove the divine intervention element, by explaining the science behind the plagues, etc.There are also moments when it moves forward in time and we just have to guess that that is the case.The cast are pretty awful and the ones with any experience, Ben K and Sigourney barely get any lines. Mother didn't even spot that Sigourney was in it.Let's put it this way, I don't think there will be many R.E. Teachers using this to teach the story of Moses."
" Ridley Scott's modern Re-telling of a Biblical Tale
",2021-02-08 00:00:00,7,"As someone who recognises Ridley Scott as a force in Cinema and a fan of many of his Films, I have to say that 'Exodus: Gods & Kings' is not among his best. Scott has decided to modernise the Biblical tale in ways that make the entire story more 'plausible' to a modern audience. Thus, he starts with the Battle of Kadesh to give the film an exciting opening before moving on to the Moses/Ramses face off and the well known aftermath. Religious purists criticised the Film for 'inaccuracy' and changing the 'known facts' of the story - absolutely astounding thinking as the Bible is not an 'Historical Document' and, indeed, there is no mention of a 'Moses' in any surviving texts of the time. Even the idea that the Hebrew slaves 'built the Pyramids' etc is now seriously in doubt as Archaeologists can find no evidence at all for this assertion. Even the inclusion that the pharaoh referred to was Ramses II is a total guess as the name is never quoted in the biblical texts.
Leaving aside the source material, the Film looks fantastic - ancient Egypt looks fabulous and the cinematography is superb. All of the main sequences are well done but the entire Film suffers from a curious lack of emotion and connection. The Cast does it's best - Christian Bale tries to convey Moses as more of a rebel leader than a spiritual one and Joel Edgerton struggles with the role of Ramses. The real issue here is that the Script does allow the two main protagonists to really gel. I do give credit to Scott for attempting to make the tale more realistic for today's audiences but for a number of reasons this film doesn't quite work as well as it should."
" Pleasantly surprised
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,8,Maybe because my expectations were lowered by all the bad reviews I actually liked this one. Taken for a simple but efficient action movie it actually works. But most of all it's the photography and visual quality that I really appreciated. And of course Christian Bale offers a solid performance while being on screen for almost all of the scenes.
" Yawnnnnnn.
",2021-01-29 00:00:00,4,Visually fun-stunning but ultimately very wearying. I slept through the plagues but I was awake for the less than convincing parting sea and then nodding off with the postscriptum of tired Moshe Bale clinging to his stone carvings and dropping his childish God-nipper as the caravan heads further into the road to Jerusalem... very yawn-making...
" An insult to Judaism and Christianity
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,3,Average film dying to rewrite the bible. Why not get your source material from elsewhere? if you are going to deny the existence of God in the story. Between this rubbish and that Egyptian god rubbish film..Leave these tales alone ..only the Greeks seem lucky enough to become unfashionable enough that their Gods wont be rewritten. Oh well let's see what happens with the Nordic tales
" TOP CLASS HISTORICAL FILM
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,8,"What Ridley Scott has delivered here is just great. Emotionally upsetting, with epic scenes and a damn good soundtrack. And yes, I see the length of 150 minutes as the only real point of criticism. Because hardly any other biography like that of Moses is so epic that a Hollywood blockbuster is the only right one. But here a length of over 3 hours would have been more appropriate to deepen the individual characters, of which there are quite a lot, which unfortunately was only mediocre. Otherwise, one can easily feverish the story, although one knows it and although the first half of the film is only ""good"" from a dramatic point of view, which is above all because the sufferings of the Hebrews are not shown intensely enough. Some people criticize Ridley Scott for not exactly sticking to the biblical facts here. I think he's doing it just right. Just as he showed new approaches with Alien, which were not particularly well received, he is going the same way here. This gives a film whose story is generally known a certain unpredictability and freshness.
Thank you Ridley for this movie experience."
" Why?
",2020-10-08 00:00:00,4,"Why is this movie? For what audience is this movie? What's the goal of this movie? If it was because of money then, well, seeing that the costs and the box office are almost the same, this didn't go too well. It definitely wasn't because of some religios motivation because it exceeds at missing the point. So in the end all we have is a cliche action movie based on the bible made for no one. So much talent wasted if you look at the cast and also at ridley Scott. They should've just done a different movie"
" What a strange mismatch of special effects and screenplay
",2020-10-03 00:00:00,5,"The film is brimming with special effects that vary between more or less acceptable, and sometimes rather good to remarkable, but there is a mismatch between those super-realistic effects and the rest of the production. Christian Bale as Moses was an odd choice, given his recognizability. His star=power does not help the film. The effort to naturalize the story by de-mythologizing the characters and settings fails because the story really actually is a myth, at least in terms of what we are accustomed to experiencing in our own lives. Think for an instant how you would react to those special effects were they actually to occur. So, which to choose? Myth or history? Perhaps it should have been produced by Peter Jackson rather than Ridley Scott."
" just. plain. silly.
",2020-09-06 00:00:00,2,"An uncommonly stupid portrayal of what is-as the movie's title and billboard explicitly declare-supposed to be the biblical account of the Hebrews' exodus from Egypt and into the 'Promised Land.' I didn't expect an authentic account of the story. I didn't even expect a loosely-based-on telling of the story. But this film is so off the mark, in every way possible, that it has forfeited any rational and defensible right to name itself after the Bible book it is supposed to portray.I'm no scholar, so I'm not sure how much extra-biblical chronicling of the Exodus exists from antiquity; but unless there is other source material out there that is strangely and perversely contrary to the biblical account, this film certainly ranks among the most perverted presentations of supposed 'history' in the annals of motion pictures.Others have done a fine job of pointing out the silliness in the characters and plot, so there is no need for me to recite those absurdities. Suffice to say that if you're looking for some decent special effects complementing inane content, you might suffer it well."
" Awefully butchered story about Moses
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,3,"What shall I say, I have never seen such a worse adaptation regarding this Biblical story ... a small boy playing the role of God or an Angel? No explanation of Moses and his Brother and why the plagues were used against Pharaoh and his people? Aweful! Moses carving the 10 laws by himself? ... I could go on and on...
The only good thing is the Camera and the visual effects..."
" This is not a story of Exodus
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,1,"Now, I know that it's not easy making a movie after 'real' story. And I know that sometimes you need to make adjustments, like the screaming and accusing in Apollo 13.
But there is no way anyone can argue that the 'adjustments' in this movie serve the purpose of advancing the story.
It seems as if someone said let's take those 3 elements of the story and make A TON up random stuff along the way. This is just madness.Btw, you can see further evidence of low production value in the CGI just look at the red Nile.Terrible movie, I want my time back...This. Is not an exodus movie!!"
" Why was this made?
",2020-07-07 00:00:00,2,"The director sure did create an ""epic"" environment. It feels big and looks great but that is where my positives end. When you name your movie ""Exodus"", people have a specific book in mind and that book is not what this movie was based on. I'm pretty convinced that Hollywood has a different ""god"" and a different ""bible"" than the rest of us do. This version of moses was arrogant and murderous. Not the meek and humble (but still human) man working on behalf of God for the Israelites. It is obvious the director, writers and actors have a certain special disdain for God.On the secular hand, the characters lacked all emotion besides loud and arrogant. I'm not sure if loud is an emotion, but this movie thinks it is.This movie isn't worth anyone's time and energy. Read Exodus, it's a lot better."
" Exodus stage left...running...
",2020-06-30 00:00:00,6,"I'm not quite sure what went wrong with this; so it might be better start off with what went right...? Someone, Sir Ridley Scott presumably, had watched Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner in ""The Ten Commandments"" (1956) and thought that it could do with a bit of a refresh; hell it worked for Peter Jackson! Let's get onto Nina Gold and see whom she can find... three minutes later they elected on Christian Bale as Moses and Joel Edgerton as Ramses II with a supporting cast of Sigourney Weaver (Ramses' mum); Sir Ben Kingsley (""Nun"" - no, not as in Mother Theresa) and John Turturo as the Pharaoh Seti (who was reputedly both wealthy and wise, so what was he doing in this?). Only Ghassan Massoud (Grand Vizier) came anywhere near convincing anyone in his portrayal, otherwise this is really just an unashamed rip off of De Mille's version with enhanced digital - not necessarily better - special effects. What is interesting is the manifestation of Jehovah as the young boy and the imagery of the plagues sent against the Egyptians is presented in a potently gruesome, grizzly fashion. The rest of it is long, fairly run-of-the-mill and I struggled to see where the alleged $140m went."
" Exodus, but not prince of Egypt
",2020-05-29 00:00:00,6,"Like anyone who watches a movie based on a true story or even based off a book it's never 100 percent accurate, ask any movie goer. What this director and writer forgot is that it was targeting a Christian audience (for the most part) and needed to stick to the story! There are significant meaningful parts of this story that are forgotten and replaced. Moses's staff for one, not a sword. The entire relationship between God and Moses was pretty much absent. They basically filmed it as if the two never liked each other. The movie almost seems to be half on the side of the murdering villainous Ramses and half on Moses's. SEVERAL scriptures of the story weren't shown, including some of my favorite parts or they were heavily altered. I will say though there are parts in the Bible where it doesn't go into detail in which the writers had to get creative, and they did, but not in a very accurate way. I went to see this movie because I am a Christian and also a fan of Christian Bale, he is a great actor and they are moments where he and Ben Kingsley do a great job. Unfortunately because this lacked faith, heart, knowledge and respect of these biblical heroes and God for that matter, it wasn't a success."
" Should not be allowed
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,1,"This film is absolutely nothing like the story it purports to be telling. It suggests it's a portrayal of the account in the Tanach and Bliblical Old Testament of Moses leading the Israelites out of Egypt. The story is almost completely made up in the mind of author and is not taken at all from the manuscripts in which the account actually exists. It is insulting to the devout Jew and Christin alike. There should be some warning at the beginning of the film that it has absolutely no likeness to the Tanach / Biblical accounts of Moses, and apologise for the insult it is to those who truly believe. Absolutely horrendous!!!"
" Unnecessary violence against animals
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,5,"If there hadn't been so much attention on the various ways to kill horses, I would've given a higher rating."
" Absolute nonsense...
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,1,What a load of absolute nonsense... totally unscriptural!
" Dull and overly long
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,2,"Having little knowledge of the backstory of this film, and not caring overly much about these certain historical biblical period piece dramas. Found Exodus to be quite boring at many parts, overly long and dragging on in several instances. There were a few scenes which sparked some interest but overall, this was not a great watch. One is not surprised at the criticism this movie has faced, resulting into an obvious box office disaster (given it's $140 million dollar budget)."
" Better than most reviews claim
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,8,"Joel Edgerton doing the whole thing as Richard Burton, Ben Mendelsohn in eyeliner and Christian Bale at his earnest best - what's not to like? I saw it was on TV and watched out of curiosity then was hooked in about 10 minutes. It seems to have annoyed a lot of Christians for not sticking to the facts(!) but I found the revisions to the plot quite interesting and it was more believable than the book"
" Could have been amazing, but it's the opposite
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,1,"Just read the actual book of Exodus. If you cannot read, then watch the cartoon, the Prince of Egypt, it is way better. Not worth renting... So you think you are going to see one of the great stories of the Bible by watching this, guess again. Why, why, why, would you alter the 2000+ year old account of the Exodus that still amazes, to present some rubbish twist of the account that WAS written by Moses. So to tell it otherwise with Moses as main character is frustrating. Also, to portray God as a emotional child who always bickering with Moses and vise versa, not the humbled man Moses is told to be, it is not the God of the Bible or the man Moses (shows complete ignorance of the writers and those involved in the production). God uses man to accomplish his goals, he used Moses and demonstrated his power through him, from the burning bush to using the staff, to parting the water... This movie just gets it all wrong, visual affects are great, acting is good. So why one star? You can't allow ignorant people to just rewrite history to give your own twist on events that is totally an unnecessary change, and get away with it because of technology and CGI. It is like it is on purpose to try and make people discount the Bible and God, and I'm not ignorant it is ""just a movie"", but you have just lowered everyone's intelligence and knowledge by releasing this trash story."
" Distortion of Islamic original history!!
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,1,How dare they are? Who give the permission to destroy the actual history of Islam? In original history there Feraon (remeses) die under the sea but in this movie its not happen that way. Also there are lots of distortion make by this film. Wast of 2:30 hours 😑
" Exodus Delivers
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,8,"The story of Exodus is one of the most timeless, significant stories of history, and portraying it in a Hollywood epic was a Herculean task. Whenever Biblical material is tackled, there are two groups the director must please: religious folks, who expect word for word Biblical accuracy, and non-religious folks, who just want an action packed movie, which is not overtly religious. This film doesn't please either of these two groups. So Exodus was destined to receive bad reviews, which is a shame, because it is a spectacular film. The rivalry between family members Moses (Christian Bale) and Ramsees (Joel Edgerton) provides tension from beginning to end. Alberto Iglesias' musical score alone is worth the admission. An exciting watch, especially at Easter!"
" What is this movie?
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,1,Is this movie any related to the biblical stories of Moses? If yes...then the director has to do more readings.
" Ridley could have done better
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,4,The acting was average by everyone in the movie. This is because the script and the cinematography lacks credibility. Special effects were awesome and can see why this wasn't released in the US. Much more script could have done well and kept to the story line instead of mixing along the way.I watched it 'coz of Ridley Scott and I was utterly disappointed.
" Not a true depiction of the bible story!
",2020-03-29 00:00:00,1,"I usually don't write reviews and am not happy that this one has to be a bad one, but depicting a bible story is of utter importance and a moral obigation to be correct or not be done at all, and this one is simply wrong.The movie is visually alright but that is not what a bilbe story is about.Moses is depicted as a very confident general, but was he in the bible? The man who did not feel comfortable approaching the Israelites himself, who let his brother Aaron talk instead?God did not appear to him as a child in the bible, did he?BEFORE every Plague, Moses approached the pharao do warn him and give him the chance to let the Isralites go to prevent a plauge from happening.The water was split - not a tsunami - although I like the approach that everything that happened are naturally occuring events, just much more intensive then normally.I could go on, but I think I made my point: Don't mess with a bible story, make it right or don't make it at all!"
" Why Faraw King Alive!
",2020-03-27 00:00:00,8,"Enjoyed this movie but problem is story has been mixed with actually story. Faraw King has been died in river but in this movie Faraw King is still alive, beside there is no visible face of God so how can you show show real existence! It should be hidden or you can make it just echo voice."
" With nowhere near the auditory or visual pop and splendour of Kingdom of Heaven,
",2020-02-14 00:00:00,5,"With no lessons learned from the much better paced Directors Cut of that film and with none of that film's current social relevance, Scott's Exodus is not as well written as Gladiator and relies on its star power instead of its character development. And while Bale is excellent, and whitewashing is a complicated issue that I won't touch, the moments brown-face does go a little too far. Was there ever any legs in the idea of a gritty realistic Moses story? I don't know. But what I do know is absolutely every ounce of Scott's magic is absent in this film, save for a few decently constructed scenes and the requisite good design. It's an immediately boring, toneless, pointless hodgepodge."
" it's not a perfect movie, but it's good entertainment
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,7,"I really don't understand why people dislike so much this film. Although we know its flaws - like the plot being very similar to Gladiator or Bale's not so convincing acting -, it is always a film that I watch when is on TV. The production is great and the film pace keeps you enterntained for the whole movie. Bottom line: don't just go watch the film based on the very bad or very good reviews (in fact, be aware of film reviews that says the films are ""worrible"" or ""wonderful"") - it is not the best film directed by Ridley Scott, but for sure it deserved a better score in IMDB."
" Did not like it
",2020-01-05 00:00:00,4,"The story is weak and quite short for 150 minutes.
The action offers little action and is sometimes boring.
The only positive thing is the performance of Christian Bale."
" A good movie ..soundtrack..only bad for religion ppl
",2019-12-09 00:00:00,9,"A good movie ..soundtrack..also pic...
only bad for religion people
Open your mind guys its not history book"
" Misunderstood, but profound.
",2019-11-24 00:00:00,10,"Surely very misunderstood, from what I gathered reading some reviews. However if one keeps his/her mind open and see the beauty in the choices and depth of Moses's portrayal and God's by Ridley, one can really enjoy and have a cathartical experience. Loved it."
" Not a big Bible movie fan
",2019-11-14 00:00:00,10,"But I enjoyed this film, I love Bale's acting, Edgerton's also, a long movie, but I watched it beginning to end, great special effects!"
" Diverting Enough...
",2019-11-04 00:00:00,6,"I ironically first became aware of this film when it became the centre of a firestorm of criticism about five years ago over the 'whitewashing' of history by casting hot caucasian Sigourney Weaver as an ancient Egyptian queen. (This may have been a canny publicity ploy to get us to all watch it, since she's hardly in it, but thanks to all the 'negative' publicity surrounding her role in it we certainly do now; which is why I bothered to watch it in the first place!)Ironically it's her accent that was actually the most incongruous aspect of her presence in it; and the wide range of accents throughout the cast that most recalled the old Hollywood biblical epics of the fifties.'Gods and Kings' does have the odd sliver of wit that makes it worth trudging through, and both the cast and the design often look good; although the cartoonish CGI aerial shots will probably date it even faster than it's fifties forbears."
" Depressingly disappointing...
",2019-11-04 00:00:00,2,"I think Scott lost his way directorially a some time ago. This film is, sadly, no exception. This has little to offer in terms of anything new in the biblical epic genre. Especially irritating is the mix of disparate accents that kill one's ability to believe and immerse oneself in the on-screen story. The visual effects are good but the movie has no soul and the cast are such a hotchpotch of actors clearly not suitable for their respective roles. All-in-all it left me feeling like the movie was pointless to watch - I just couldn't get into it. It could and should have been so much better."
" Wasted talent and an old story embellished.
",2019-09-03 00:00:00,2,"Ridley Scott has given us some epic movies, Alien springs to mind, as does Gladiator and also Blade Runner.This is definitely NOT one of them. I would even go so far as to say ""who are you, and what have you done with Ridley?""I am a big fan of Ben Kingsley and will generally watch any movie in which he stars.Unfortunately, both he and Sigourney Weaver, two talented actors, were completely wasted in itty bitty roles and I was left wondering how and why they were enticed to stoop so low.The money must have been very good.Christian Bale (loved him as Batman) was a poor, unemotional Moses and his role in this biblical story was almost completely ignored. There were no ""let my people go"" moments. Director Scott has done his utmost to present the plagues as occurring due to natural phenomena.I wonder whether he tried to think of a way to make the killing of the first born seem natural too, although to his credit, he didn't attempt such folly.His presentation of God as a nasty, vengeful, precocious brat was unsettling, to say the least and I must admit to being slightly offended by his choice of metaphor.Aaron too, a central character in the biblical account, was relegated to the level of an also ran, despite his having been accredited as Moses' 'mouthpiece'.The film was overly reliant on (in my opinion mediocre) special effects, and very thin on getting the best out of the actors, all of whom have, and could have, done much better.This is an ideal movie to showcase special effects but Scott's need to retell the story with his own (anti?) biblical slant, missed many opportunities to create a spectacular epic.Raining hail and fire was missing, the plagues being presented as a natural course of events.We also didn't get the snakes, Moses starting the plague of blood or any of them, he was relegated to the role of a spectator.No clouds by day and pillar of fire by night.In leaving out so much of the original story, Scott has relegated what could have been a grand epic to 'just another movie', one where I found myself hitting the fast forward so I could get to the end and then to bed."
" Better Than Average Sword and Sandal- Exodus: Gods and Kings
",2019-08-30 00:00:00,6,"Ridley Scott is a master of special effects and action. There is plenty of both in this film. There is also a dearth of screenwriting and adaptation, unfortunately, and it holds back the film from being a few notches higher. It is not as good as Gladiator, and not as good as the original Ten Commandments, which had very few special effects, actually. The special effects in this film bury the original, but are buried by the mundane performances of the actors. Mr. Bale is really not up to the level of acting required for this role. John Tutturo was very good, however. But the worst miscasting was for Ramses (the ghost of Yul Brenner must be spinning in his grave). That portrayal was God-awful and kept the film from A status. Ben Kingsley gives it his Edward G Robinson best shot at a small role, and does all right, but where is your Messiah now, NYAH? Why not include Billy Crystal in the fillm; he would have been a better Ramses than the one that played him. Egyptians didnt have a British accent, eh what? The mountain side scene was the best in the film for me; great filmmaking, but not quite enough to make up for the serious writing problems. When will Hollywood learn to spend at least 1% on good writing. For 1.5 million, you could get Shakespeare to write the damn thing. Despite all these misfirings, Scott single-handedly pulled off a better than average epic. There have been several that have been worse, but there has also been several that were better."
" A visual treat, yet something is sorely missing
",2019-08-24 00:00:00,5,"I was hesitant to watch Exodus, despite my love for Ridley Scott and his style, as I heard many stories about the filmmakers and actors not fully grasping the story of the Book of Exodus. Scott, as an atheist, was a strange director to make a Biblical story. I was pleased with Exodus as an exclusively epic scale film, however it's Biblical aspects are thoroughly lacking.For a start, the story is only slightly partially faithful to the Exodus narrative and there are many, many, many small aspects that are changed. For example, Moses kills two Egyptians in an alleyway instead of one and he does so to protect his identity not to save a beaten Hebrew. Another aspect is the lack of Moses' staff and its use in the crossing of the Red Sea. What is worse is that there are many more essential details that are missing: Moses and Aaron meet far too late into the story, the plagues occur out of order, the burning bush IS God (not the angel). So many things are left out and they seem small to regular audiences but to the Christians watching, it is quite a travesty.The movie is largely centred around its visuals, which is fine for an epic to do, but there has to be an underlying substance to hold all that spectacle up. And sadly Exodus has very little substance. I found it very hard to relate to anyone in the film, even the enslaved Hebrews. It was a struggle to empathise with the characters. I want to say the visuals and production design make up for the lack of characterisation, but I cannot. I love Scott's visual style but it cannot float without good characterisation. But I must say... my goodness is this film a beauty to look at. Both computer-generated and practical, the production is truly great. Expected for a Scott film.The acting overall is fine. No one really stands out to me apart from Joel Edgerton. His broken character is all that makes this movie more than an empty eye-candy fest. Bale is a very strange pick for Moses, but I grew on him as the film progressed. Everyone talks about Bale's casting being strange but I find Ben Mendelson's casting as the viceroy the weirdest thing I have ever seen in an epic film. And I've seen some weird Epics (also can we just point out that Ewen Bremmer, the guy who said in AVP ""now this is like finding Moses' DVD collection"" is featured in an Exodus film? I genuinely think Scott hired him just to make that gag).I wanted this to be so much more, but I guess having a Biblical film directed by an atheist, this is the best kind of result we could have gotten."
" Not exactly true to the Biblical story!
",2019-08-18 00:00:00,2,"I started to watch this film last night on TV and after about an hour, switched it off. To start with, it bears NO relationship to the Biblical story whatsoever (Exodus). There is no record of the Hebrews being taught to fight and the telling of Moses and the burning bush is twisted out of all recognition! It put me in the mind of Darren Aronofsky's version of Noah (with Russel Crowe) which had a very similar handling. Both would be better being labelled ""based upon the story in the Old Testament"" because that's about as close as it gets!"
" Horrible
",2019-08-10 00:00:00,1,"This is not Moses story. Unreal story, horrible acting, bad cgi. everything in this movie is just bad."
" Below par
",2019-08-02 00:00:00,5,"Bit naff. Only watched it all because Christian Bale was Moses. Oddly this film made me question whether the ""miracles"" were in fact miracles, or whether they were just random acts of nature."
" Flawed Exodus
",2019-07-16 00:00:00,7,"Follows the basic story from the bible, but too many unanswered questions. For example, what happened to Miriam the sister of Moses? According to the bible she leaves Egypt with the Israelites and is part of the leadership. However in the movie ahe disappears after saying goodbye to Moses as he heads into exile. Could have been a better flick by staying closer to the bible"
" Very good IF you have an open mind.
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,9,"As a Christian, I take the Bible very seriously. In Deuteronomy 4:2, God tells the Israelites: ""You shall not add to the word which I am commanding you, nor take away from it, that you may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.""When Bible movies add things God did not place in His words, it can be bothersome to me-though I do enjoy movies like Noah and The Last Temptation of Christ. I have realized overtime that these movies are not intended to be the Bible onscreen, but rather inspirations from the director's mind, and not literal adaptations. That's all I will say on that here, before I get off topic or, perhaps, controversial.Exodus: Gods and Kings was directed by Ridley Scott, who's an atheist. His interpretation of the classic Moses story was originally one of the 10 worst movies I had ever seen, and I therefore gave it a 2/10. You can tell that from older reviews I have written.I mentioned that last month at a church youth group meeting when we compared the Burning Bush scenes in The Ten Commandments, The Prince of Egypt, and this. We all cringed at this version of it, which has many changes, such as Moses falling in quicksand and breaking his leg and a little boy talking to Moses, not the bush. But we compared it to the book of Exodus and found similarities between the Biblical narrative and the movie.However, on June 11th, 2019 I rewatched Exodus Gods and Kings and realized that it very much requires an open mind-and one with a movie in mind and not The Bible. It does follow the overall skeleton structure of the story, but it puts new flesh on it. I gave you the Burning Bush example, and I'll leave you to the others to examine yourself.I have heard that the effects are dull, but I highly disagree! The Red Sea Parting looks awesome, and I'm sure Cecil B. DeMille is rolling in his grave that Scott could make it cooler! The Plagues are nice too, I truly believed that all the water turned to blood and that insects and frogs were covering Egypt. Exodus Gods and Kings has set the standard for epic film-making in the regard of special effects!I also think the pacing is nice. It runs for exactly 2.5 hours and it felt more like 2. Some think The Ten Commandments(a nearly 4 hour movie) felt shorter, and AT TIMES I could see that, but it definitely does not apply to the whole film.On a grade scale of A+ to F, I am going to have to give this a simple A. I did have a couple of inaccuracy and other minor issues, ones I would rather not mention in favor of how much I admired Exodus Gods and Kings my 2nd time around, and they are also rather hard to put into words. But that is besides the point. There is so much good it overshadows any issues.In respect of Ridley Scott's vision, I admire and recommend Exodus Gods and Kings. Like I said, it requires an open mind to watch it, not a Bible to movie comparison. It's astonishing effects and unique storytelling(which I should note make you wonder what Moses's life was like out of the Bible's teachings) and interesting casting choices make this a pretty good Bible movie for the modern audience who want a fresh take on Moses.It's epic, it's grandly shot, and it's Ridley Scott's interpretation of Moses. Take it or leave it. I took it, and now I admire it! I could make more comments in favor of the movie, but for now I'll take an Exodus from this review! Exodus Gods and Kings is a spectacular vision and one worth experiencing if you are interested.As of 10/8/19: Movies I ""Really Like"" and ""Liked"" will be 9/10 stars."
" my notes
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,4,Meh. it was ok but long and boring. a cool visualization of the story. good directing and cool scenes. Christian bale is still a beast (1 viewing)
" This film is nothing to do with TORAH,QURAAN,BIBLE
",2019-05-25 00:00:00,1,This movie has no relationship with religious beliefs.This is not based on true events
" Visually spectacular but with no soul
",2019-05-23 00:00:00,5,"Visually it was stunning!! but for me the film didn't really know where it was going, it wanted the audience to decide on what they thought really happened! which I think lost at lot of the emotional factor to this great story!!!
Also I believe Ridley decided to try and please everyone but in the end that just made it potentialy being a great film in to a mediocre one."
" Wasted potential on an epic scale
",2019-04-24 00:00:00,4,"On paper, Exodus: Gods and Kings sounds like a surefire hit - proven starpower, an obscene budget and a suitably large story. Unfortunately, this film should have stayed as just a idea.Director Ridley Scott uses as much CGI as possible to compensate for the dull script, making Christian Bale and Joel Edgerton's jobs an uphill battle. Their acting abilities become diluted by the overly-serious tone, restricting them to playing only a fraction of their character's potentials.It doesn't get any better at the film moves forward, relying on the biblical storyline to carry the rest of the production: more famous actors and panoramic scenes are exploited, but nothing makes any meaningful impact on the viewer whatsoever. By midway into this 150 minute slog, you'll be praying for the credits to roll."
" The CGI is Great But the Whole Thing Just Falls Flat
",2019-04-22 00:00:00,7,"Insert plagues here then return us to a long, drawn-out version of what should be an epic story. Alas, filmmaker Riddley Scott lays an egg. Portraying the image of God as an 11 year-old child? No pillars of fire? The only worthwhile changes involve Moses' love for his wife and his adopted brother, Ramses II. Like ""Scrooge"" this story has been filmed many times before. The only two versions I like are the 1956 De Mille extravaganza and Dreamwork's animated ""Prince of Eqypt."" Can you say different?"
" Horrible, real miracles replaced by hollywood tricks
",2019-03-14 00:00:00,3,"It could have been such a beautiful meaningful film. Great actors, good budget, wonderful story.
And then they mess up the story. The wonders that happened are ignored or rationalized. And then new impossible events - wonders or rather, 'hollywood tricks- are squeezed in..
Why? Why?"
" A beautiful historical mythology movie.
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,10,"10/10 - regardless of watching it as a religious movie and watching it as a historical fiction movie, you will be very entertained by the visual effects, the story plot and the music.Christian Bale as Moses was the man of the movie for me."
" Visually great, but with changed story and without a soul, sadly.
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,6,"As a visual spectacle its a treat, really. 8 stars. So if you are not a Christian its entertaining. Else you are in for a shock: parts of the Biblical story are rewritten!
To a degree I can understand adding a few sideline stories and adding in the Bible unmentioned details, but altering the main character, Mozes, baffles me. In the book Mozes is humble in a way but Bale (a good actor) turned him into anything but that. He's a warlord kinda person. Worse, Bale played like if he hated the role. Hence his character feels hollow.
The pharao has a more interesting character but is depicted as a bit of a crazy madman. Why? Also puzzling: God is... a kid. Personally I can live with that chouce but weird it is.
And then there is the famous scene at the red sea. Its spiced up with a dozen tornados (luckely they left out flying sharks...) Oh and Mozes and Ramses have a sort of 1on1 standoff in the middle, seconds before the tsunami (!) hits and... both survive. Its downright crazy.
This could have been a great movie, now its pretty good fun, but only as simple entertainment without the Biblical perspective. If you count that in 4 stars would be the max."
" A decent film for what it sets out to do
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,7,"If you're looking for an enjoyable action/adventure/drama movie based on Exodus then this movie is worth a watch. I feel a lot of the low scores are unjust and must be because of other people's impossibly high expectations given what Exodus means to them or they wanted deep drama with character development (something the actual book was no good at either). I just read Exodus for the first time recently (I'm not religious) and decided to watch this movie. The movie follows the book quite closely with only a few minor changes which I felt actually made the story more believable and compelling. The boring parts of the story have all been kept out or displayed rather, in a manner that requires very little scene time but enough to pay homage to the original. Overall, the movie finds a decent balance between action, adventure and drama to tell its story but doesn't excel in any category. A slightly above average movie that is worth a watch but this movie doesn't bring anything exceptional to the table."
" CGI movie with historical setting
",2019-01-25 00:00:00,3,"The movie does not meet any criteria that comes with this heavy topic and fails everywhere.
Three stars because I like the CGI and the actors because I know they can act good, in other movies though.It is probably one of the most famous biblical stories and I would expect the movie will thematise aspects like faith and struggles in difficult situations, the fight between god's will vs individual will, morality, ...
Moses as the key figure with his change from pharao's royal family member into leader of Isrealites and prophet of the one true god.
But what is shown is a Moses who doesnt believe in his god, who does not know why he is doing what, who is unwilling to follow god's way ... and all started because Moses had an accident and was hit on this head, really?!
OK, who wouldnt doubt like Moses when god is portrait as unreasonable, angry and vengeful little kid... while writing this review I noticed that Ramses is more multifaceted portrait then Moses.At some points the movie tries change perspectives, tries to show situations from different view point, question but also fails as it doesnt go enought into depth, doesnt give the characters the opportunity to develop. Instead characters change from scene to scene with contrary behavior.Actually I cannot remember having seen a good Ridley Scott movie for quite some timeSome examples:
Struggle with faith is portrait as two people openly questioning Moses decisions and his reply is something like: follow me because I say so or die. So the Hebrews dont even accept Moses as his prophet but just follow him as he is less evil compared to Egypt slavery.Moses is secretly watched when talking to little child god, creating the perception of mentally ill person.Moses always only talks to 3 Hebrews but convinces all of the thousands others.Moses leaves his wife and kid because of his visions after head insury and because he was told he and his skills are needed for what to come. Actually Moses does not do anything except of displeasing little child god, not knowing what is happening, not knowing what to do, not agreeing with god's will, not really caring about what is happening.Moses grew up with Ramses as brothers. Ramses doesnt hesitate to cut off the arm of Moses' foster-mother just because some guy said some rumours about Moses. Then Ramses exiles Moses but gives him his sword as help for survival. Later Ramses orders Moses' death not thinking twice but always keeps a welcoming tone when they speak to each other.Ramses"
" Um. You forgot the biggest scene in the Bible
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,1,"What happened to the Red Sea parting. That is like the most important and cinematic scene in this biblical story and you didn't even address it. What a rip off!I've never seen a worse biblical movie-well, maybe Noah with Russel Crowe was worse... but still. Ugh. Terrible."
" Not Really Sure About This One
",2019-01-04 00:00:00,6,"I was really confused how to rate this movie. As a spectacle and action movie it was good. Good battle scenes, great CGI, decent performances especially from Bale. But I am Catholic and no matter how much you view this as an action movie it is very much aimed at being a historical masterpiece and it's there where it fails. It is really inaccurate and bordering on offensive. Sometimes there is a degree of artistic licence a director can use but I think where religion is concerned they should not stray as it such a sensitive subject and means so much to many. A decent action movie but no more than that and if you are Christian or Catholic I would probably give it a swerve"
" Nice movie!
",2018-12-08 00:00:00,8,"I really don't believe in god, but I like this movie!"
" Beyond Ridiculous
",2018-11-28 00:00:00,1,"The director has really gone completely overboard on this one, reinventing the entire story and making it positively more ridiculous and incredible than it already was in the Old Testament version. One cannot help but think that this movie was actually conceived as a bizarre form of propaganda to bolster failing support for the Jewish state. (I am allowed to say that, I am Jewish). As (Jewish) historian Simon Shama points out in his recent book dealing with the history of the Jews, Jewish life in ancient Egypt was not as unpleasant as it has been portrayed. Plus, the construction of the pyramids and even more elaborate sculptures and buildings is hardly the work of an unskilled workforce. The notion that the Jews were slaves in Egypt and that they built all the beautiful stuff is patently absurd. Yet that is precisely the impression this film leaves us with.It is one thing to create a work of artistic imagination and something other to criticise or oppose common beliefs. This film accomplishes neither, it simply blows everything utterly out of proportion in a way that leaves one feeling the director should have stayed with the incredible - aliens -, rather than mess with something he and those funding him obviously know absolutely nothing about.The film is patently racist in its portrayal of the Egyptians as primitives and cruel. It lacks in imagination where it comes to attempting to understand the politics and economics underpinning its supposed scenario.Worst of all, with the current rise of anti-intellectualism and hardcore Christian fundamentalism in the USA, this film may reach and young and impressionable audience of youngsters whose education has left them ill equipped to recognise its propagandistic value."
" Like watching paint dry
",2018-10-05 00:00:00,3,This must be Ridley Scotts most boring movie. Such a disappointment.
" What??
",2018-09-28 00:00:00,3,As far as special effects go and action that was good. But it strayed far from the story of Moses and God. If you are going to tell a story than stay accurate with how it is already known. To me it made it seem like they were trying to portray God as vegenful and unmerciful and Moses as this unhearted man that had no real faith. When truth God gave them a choice each time and they turned away.
" WE CROSS HERE
",2018-09-13 00:00:00,6,"This review compares the film to the biblical text and as such may contain ***plot spoilers***. The opening starts in the unknown years of Moses (Christian Bale) between Exodus 2:10 and 2:11. He is the brother of the Ramses (Joel Edgerton), son of the Pharaoh (John Turturro). The incident of killing the Egyptian is downplayed. Moses is exiled (did not flee) more due to prophecy. They created a scene where he discovers his true lineage, something that the Bible glossed over.His encounter with ""God"" was with that of a child, one might think was a hallucination. Indeed future encounters show Aaron (Andrew Tarbet) spying on Moses as he talks to himself, while Moses believes he is talking to God. Moses carves the 10 Commandments by his own hand as the little God looks on. His conversations with God is not what is recorded in the Bible, except for maybe an ""I AM.""Moses does not return to Egypt with his wife (María Valverde) and son (Hal Hewetson) as one would gather from the Bible (Ex 4:20) which created the need for a reuniting scene later in the film.The Red Sea parting was a ""huh"" moment as the waters seemed to have simply subsided. The return of the water used cyclones and was more of a scene.Christian Bale played a more subdued Moses, perhaps a man who suffered from hallucinations caused by an injury.Clearly Bible believers will like this film about as much as the rock creatures in ""Noah."" In an attempt to make this a ""historical"" film circa 1300 BCE, the film creators unknowingly point out chronology problems. If the goal of the viewer is to watch a film of ""could of"", ""maybe"", then this film might have some appeal, unless one looks too deep."
" A tragicomedy pure and simple..
",2018-08-30 00:00:00,1,"Firstoff, this movie is an immaculate joke and speaks clearly how hollywood has changed for the worse since the end of the 90's. No bloody substance whatsoever, instead, let's get white A-list actors and Ridley + 150 million and produce a fantasy tale with the typical mesmerizing special effects. We all know that this will at least be a hit at the boxoffices. Bloody hell how ludicrously waste of no brain at all. But it sells, right...Secondly, all i read in the user reviews are two types - wannabe-movie-knowitall-brats and biased christians.. everywhere. The christian reviewers are especially notable for their ridiculous outrage for this movie not following their vision and version of the bible haha. Well, if you nutjobs didn't know by now, there's never been any historical facts presented that 1. Moses even existed. 2. He got supernatural commanments from a supernatural being. 3. And lastly, there are zero evidence (except from being written in the bible) that jews walked for 40 years in any desert, nor that there existed any pharoah from Egypt who owed jewish slaves.So dear readers, in conclusion.. an objective and genuinly movie loving individual, who also loves and respect and love actual historical context - why would one even contemplate of watching this piece of crap of a movie, but also, not be disturbed by the ridiculously inaccurate tale of historical storytelling?"
" HORRIBLE!
",2018-08-25 00:00:00,1,"Ridley Scott, you should be ashamed of yourself. Have you ever read Exodus, much less the bible? And Ben Kingsley, how could you play a role in this movie. You should know better."
" Well Acted But Poorly Paced
",2018-08-23 00:00:00,6,"What could you compare this movie to except Cecil B. DeMille's 1956 epic ""The Ten Commandments."" They're very different movies telling the same story - that of the exodus of the Hebrew slaves from Egypt described in the Book of Exodus in the Bible and fleshed out for the big screen on several occasions, most notably the aforementioned 1956 version. This story is quite different. It places a lot more emphasis on Moses' early years. Here, Moses is a military leader of Egypt who grew up in the same home as Ramses, Pharaoh's son; in fact, the two of them were brothers, sworn to defend each other. The movie opens with a battle between the Egyptians and the Hittities. Ramses commands the Egyptian forces, but his life is saved in the battle by Moses and Moses is hailed as a hero - the start of the jealousy between the two that serves as the engine for everything else that happens basically.Once you get through the filler about Moses' early life (because it's all extremely speculative - not even the biblical account says much about Moses' early life - the rest of the story seems a bit like extended vignettes. Moses is exiled, Moses is called by God, Moses returns to Egypt, God brings plagues on the Egyptians, the Hebrews are freed, the Egyptians pursue them, etc., etc. Of the latter material I thought some of it was well done. The plagues in particular impressed me. They were largely seen as natural occurrences, but the hand of God is seen to be involved. The crossing of the Red Sea was done very differently than DeMille's version, but was still effective. On the other hand, Moses' call from God seemed underplayed and not as dramatic as it should have been - and perhaps even delusional, caused by Moses being hit on the head by a rock after a rockslide! Atheists no doubt will appreciate that (as, I'm sure, did Christian Bale, who played Moses and expressed some very negative beliefs about Moses) but I thought it weakened the drama of the story. But I did like the fact that God was portrayed in this movie as a young boy. That put me in mind of Isaiah 11:6 - ""and a little child shall lead them.""The performances generally were decent enough. I actually liked Bale as Moses. His constant battle with God over his call, his general reluctance to be the leader of God's people. Bale portrayed all that very well. Compared to the 1956 movie, Ridley Scott (even in spite of CGI) put together less of a ""spectacle"" I thought. This movie was ""earthier"" if I could put it that way. But as I suggested above, the pacing was off, and considering how little happened after the crossing of the Red Sea, the movie could have easily been cut by about 20 minutes and the movie could have ended with the destruction of the Egyptian Army rather than the cursory nod toward the commandments and Moses' later life. This isn't a bad movie, but it's also not a great one."
" Disappointed
",2018-08-12 00:00:00,5,"I love Ridley Scott and his vision. A big production that lost elements of the story. Mistaken juxtaposition, bits and pieces felt passionate, as is Mr Scott's usual storytelling. Mismatched, plenty of holes, character development fail. The actors weren't genuine to their roles. Felt all over the place. My reveiw pretty much sums up my discombobulated view, broken. Was it the way it was edited? Love Christian Bale for all of his other roles. Perhaps Moses would have been better cast with someone unknown. Or lesser known. Just a thought."
" Worst depiction of Bible history I've ever seen!
",2018-08-04 00:00:00,1,"I've never written a movie review before, but had to do so for this one, for the sheer principle. This movie is one of, if not the worst, depiction of any Bible narrative I have ever seen. The inaccuracies in this movie are almost immeasurable in comparison to the real Bible narrative of Moses and the Exodus. There is such a thing as poetic license and then there is just straight Hollywood pablum. If you are a Christian and love the beautiful story of Moses and the Exodus and have yet to see this movie, please don't waste your time or intelligence. If you are not a Christian, this comes nowhere near depicting the events of the story of Moses in the Bible. If you are still inclined to watch this horrible abomination, read the book of Exodus in the Bible first, then you will see how terribly skewed this depiction is."
" So complete, long, and entertaining
",2018-08-01 00:00:00,9,"If you thought all Moses movies were bored, stop right there because you will love this film. The background of Moses is shown in a different way, having the director filling the blanks of the Bible. No passage is changed, but the add-ons of the director makes this story so interesting you will want to repeat it. The relation between God, Moses, Ramses, and the Jewish people is taken to a different level"
" Why ruin a good story with the real story?
",2018-07-04 00:00:00,2,Ridley Scott completely went off the actual story in creating this movie that does not even come close to the story in scriptures. If you are looking for a movie that tells the story as told in scripture this is not it.
" They tried to recreat the majesty of the 1956 film...
",2018-06-23 00:00:00,3,"..andt failed...the main problem is, it isn't easy to put modern dialog into ancient Egypt. This telling lacks any real depth, and feels wooden as a result.Ridley Scott tried to project the majestic panorama of Egypt, and the collosal wonders, but stopped short of making the canvas live...I really can't go on, this telling of the bible is frankly poorly done, and the old Charleton Heston version far outshines it into obscurity...Stick to Aliens Ridley, you'll stand a better chance..."
" An insulting, sacrilegious abomination of a film
",2018-03-18 00:00:00,1,"The writers took was one of the most recognized and repeated stories in the Bible and totally butchered it. There were so many egregious things in this film is hard to know where to start. The legs were presented out of order and totally out of context. Perhaps the most ridiculous and disturbing part of the film was substituting a young child for the Burning Bush, a.k.a. the voice of God, who has a running conversation with Moses which made no sense whatsoever.It is one thing to take a few artistic liberties. In this epic disaster, they added events that never existed anywhere in any retelling of the Exodus story such as a group of Hebrew resistance fighters which Moses trained himself.The acting was awful and the dialogue was even worse. The actor who played Ramses could have mailed in his performance. It was the most underwhelming portrayal of a central character in the story that I had ever seen. At least Christian Bale can act when he has to. However, the only thing that this movie got correct about Moses was the retelling of his birth and how he was placed in a basket and sent downstream on the River Nile to the Pharaoh's Palace, etc.. Everything else that was important to the story of Moses was left out such as the staff he carried with him at all times and replaced it with the gold Egyptian sword that he had received as an adopted son of Pharaoh.Do yourself a favor and ""pass over"" this film."
" Why dilute a good thing?!
",2018-03-17 00:00:00,1,I've read the bible narrative and other books that parallel the biblical account and I was hoping to see the updated modern version of the 1965 movie The 10 Commandments. But that was soon dashed to the ground as Ridley Scott seemed to make great effort to corrupt the story with additions so wildly off based like depicting God as an angry vindictive child. I was almost shocked that kept the plagues in the movie or that the Hebrews were even let go by Ramses. Yeah it's one of those type of movies that takes such creative freedom with the story that the True account known by so many is lost sight of. An opportunity was missed by Mr.Scott to make a great classic if he just stayed with the story as told in scripture. I would never recommend anyone waste 2 hrs of their life sitting and watching this story cause not only has it been falsified but the acting in it is bland and sadly one dimensional.
" Rubbish!
",2018-02-26 00:00:00,1,"Pure rot! Acting stunk, the script stunk, we just couldn't watch it all, it gave me a sick feeling."
" Had promise but failed miserably.
",2018-02-16 00:00:00,3,"First hour I was thinking this is a good retelling of a great story. Moses and Pharaoh were portrayed as men, both with faults but neither good or evil. I usually hate religious epics sooner as I feel I'm being preached to. But then around 75 minutes I saw the creation of the Israeli Defence Force, you can push history so far, but not by centuries. After fleeing Egypt they did hold a small area for awhile, but then fell under the domain of all the great competing powers in the area. When the superpowers exhausted themselves in war, Jerusalem was theirs. Until the Romans arrived, then the Muslims followed by the Crusaders. Israel is a powerful state now, but only due to the diaspora or more importantly those in the USA. Why ruin what is a great story by rewriting it and history."
" Everything depended upon the casting of Moses
",2018-01-28 00:00:00,6,"Ridley Scott has never made a bad looking film but he has seldom made an excellent one. Several reasons, including: * He seems incapable of discriminating between a bad script and a good script. * He is dependent upon the casting.But this was a film worth watching. It caught the majesty, simultaneously barbaric and spiritual, of its Biblical source.The script was variable but had its moments.But what let this film down was the total miscasting of Christian Bale who showed no depth in the role of Moses, at all. Charlton Heston was more nuanced in the Ten Commandments and Charlton Heston was not noted of being a nuancing actor! But the film, for those of us interested in the Bible, was still worth watching for its production values, some powerfully mystic moments, such as the falling star precipitating the parting of the Red Sea, and the utterly gorgeous Maria Valverde as Moses' wife Zipporah."
" Hipster Moses takes on metrosexual Pharaoh
",2018-01-25 00:00:00,1,"What in tarnation was ol' Ridley Scott thinking?Why turn a biblical story into a movie and then ditch the bible to just play with the characters in some sort of alternate universe? I'll leave that question to for Mr. Scott, as i have no idea whatsoever. Every main character in this film seems to be out of place and aware of it. While the special effects are impressive, the story makes no sense. This head-scratcher of a movie is just terrible. Even the casting is a mystery. Why Christian Bale? What was Sigourney Weaver supposed to contribute via her talent with the scarce screen time given to her? Same goes for John Turturro. Talented actors not given enough time to shine.If it turned out that this script was written on toilet paper, in 15 minutes while taking a dump at the mall i would understand what happened here.Mr. Ridley Scott, you are far better than this. Remember that."
" waste of time
",2018-01-23 00:00:00,1,"Bad acting, bad lines and no emotion. Now I know why Egypt banned this movie: to save the time and money of Egyptians"
" Scott takes on de Mille?
",2018-01-14 00:00:00,4,"When I was a kid they took us to London to see what was the most amazing film I had ever seen up to that point I think - The Greatest Story Ever Told and it was one of those in ""Cinerama"", massively wide curved screen etc. I knew the story but was bowled away by the action on screen - yes indeed, the Old Testament could be action-packed fun.
This weekend we watched Ridley Scott's take on the Old Testament on our mighty plasma TV and it looked great but of course lacked the impact of that ancient movie. Times change, we get inured to the special, novelties all too rapidly become a given on life's ratchet.
Without giving the game away even though most know the story from Sunday School, I thought it was well done, well acted, well photographed etc. It ticked all the boxes but somehow fell short. It seemed like a sequence of alternate flash and dialogue, talking exposition then crash bang wallop or is that how all movies are made these days?
Plus of course, we have LOTR and GoT to poison the well of our expectations... and for me another attempt to get my head around Scott's Alien Covenant and failing.
Unlike Gladiator I doubt we shall be buying the Box Set and rewatching Exodus."
" This movie had so much potential
",2017-12-03 00:00:00,5,"I loved most of the story line, and I could look past the battle training montage, but they screwed up the most epic scene. I would have added this movie to my collection, but it is called the *parting* of the Red Sea, not the ""refilling"" of the Red Sea. How do you mess that up???? They had the special effects budget to create the parting, and it would've been a great movie. But noooooo, they had to completely fictionalize that scene. I was so disappointed and disgusted by that."
" The secret to enjoy the movie is to forget the Bible
",2017-11-12 00:00:00,8,"It may seem unreasonable to expect viewers that are watching a movie about a Bible story that is very well known and believed by so many to forget what they know about the Bible's version of the story...But this is Hollywood, exaggeration and creativity freedom should be expected and this movie is no exception as it is an interpretation of what was written in the Bible with some parts completely made up by the writers of the movie.Ridley Scott knows how to do epic movies and this one proves it again! Beautiful scenery, great camera-work (taking us closer to the action) with glorious sound and special effects! Although I personally believe this was a missed opportunity to show what the Bible tells us (hence why I don't give it 10 out of 10), the story portrayed in the movie is still amazing, and the way all actors and director did their job make this movie an enjoyable one (regardless of personal faith)."
" Plusses and Minuses
",2017-10-02 00:00:00,2,"For the plusses: The Creator is shown to be the true God who is listened to while the gods worshiped by the Egyptians are deaf to their cries for help. Too, the CGI effects are fantastic to see and very realistic. For the negatives: primarily, the story does not follow the written record in the Bible. It does not matter whether you believe that written record is historical or not. You may believe it is purely fictional. Your opinion one way or another is insignificant. The fact is that we have four very ancient documents--the books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy--that have inspired a number of films about Moses, and for this film those documents seem to have only been studied cursorily while the imaginations of the writer and director--and maybe even the actors themselves--were allowed to go off on tangents. Why not tell the story as it appears in the documents? Not freaky enough? Moses not tough-guy enough? Moses wasn't a tough guy. He was, and I paraphrase from the documents, the most humble man to ever walk to earth, speaking with God as a friend would speak with another friend. Where's his son's foreskin being smeared all over his feet by his wife Zipporah? Too graphic for a wide audience, I suppose. Why does his brother Aaron just stand there and not do what he is traditionally supposed to do, which is to speak for Moses whenever the latter has anything at all to say? I guess that would have taken the spotlight too far away from Bale. Where's Moses' powerful staff that can part waters and make the land between dry enough to walk across or coax much- needed water from a rock or turn into a serpent-swallowing serpent? Oh, I see. The snake-eating part of the story couldn't be explained as a natural occurrence like most of the plagues are. Maybe there was a natural chain reaction for the plagues. Very possible. Until, of course, we get to the blackness that covered Egypt when the Angel of the Lord (not seen in the film) killed all of the firstborn children and livestock of the families that did not cover their door-posts with the blood of unblemished lambs. Then the natural explanations sort of fall apart. Anyway, you see my point. There was some good stuff, but most of it was action film garbage. Bale plays a better Batman than a historical Hebrew leader who is seen by most Jews as a precursor to their idea of the Messiah and by all Christians as a primary archetype of Y'shua (Jesus) the Messiah. This is not to say that Charlton Heston was ever a great anything that he played, but at least Cecil B. DeMille made an attempt to follow the received documents. I give this one a 2 out of 10, but only because of the really great CGI effects. Guess that might show you in yet another way what I believe is the most important part of telling any story received from our ancestors and ancients."
" What a wreck!
",2017-09-08 00:00:00,2,"Like a previous reviewer, I also went into this with an open mind. I mean - Ridley Scott? You can't go far wrong with him ..... can you? But I found that oh yes you can! I'll make no bones about the fact that I am a Christian and read the Bible daily so I am more than familiar with the biblical version of Exodus. This was about as similar to it as chalk is to cheese! There are so many issues, I'd need an entire page on this website to list them all! But one that really stuck in my craw was when the Hebrews finally left Egypt. Rather than the many thousands organised under their 12 tribal banners (all the sons of Jacob, if you remember) it became a mindless troupe meandering through the streets - probably a number that would shame a Harrod's sale! And Moses declaring himself lost when so near the Red Sea? What was that all about? And no pillar of fire to keep the Egyptian Pharaoh and his army back. I could go on but I think you should be getting the picture! I watched it through to the end out of a sense of astonishment and was reminded of the other Biblical travesty ""Noah"" played by the infamous Russell Crowe - about as believable as a pantomime dame! Well unlike that one, at least I never had to actually PAY to see this film! GAARRGHH!"
" Visually Stunning Movie
",2017-08-26 00:00:00,5,"A visual stunner. At a lengthy 2hours and 30 minutes, it doesn't seem so long. I was fairly entertained with this biblical tale. I was particularly impressed by the special effects and cinematography of Egypt.Kudos to the special effects team. The direction could be better , the story could be better told, as i am little lost at times since i don't know the story of Moses. Luckily i have a friend sitting beside me filling me in the bible story.I am glad i watch it , and not believing all the terrible reviews this movie garnered."
" Soulless
",2017-08-22 00:00:00,3,"Directed by Ridley Scott and with Christian Bale in the role of Moses, this film recounts the story of the Hebrews' exodus from Egypt from a more realistic and less supernatural point of view, that is, the miracles described in the Bible are events of Nature, yet it fails in this ""realism"" when it comes to the last plague, the death of the Egyptian' first-borns (only a supernatural black cloud / shadow covering the city at night and at the next morning the infants are dead just like that - there goes the realism!). It's full of historical and biblical errors - History and Scriptures are two different things conflicting many times, so it would be best to stay truthful to the story' original source, but no... (I won't go on detail on this 'cause that would take a book, not a review given the tremendous amount of underlying issues pertaining this theme ""History vs Scripture and its rewriting, voluntary or not"") Moreover, this movie does not transmit any emotion so soulless it is and fails on everything (everything!!!) that could make this an epic. Just nice scenarios and visual effects were never guaranty of a good movie."
" Inaccurate
",2017-06-29 00:00:00,4,"(Flash Review)I was anticipating a cool and visually stunning movie, with the climax most likely being Moses parting the Red Sea to save his people. While it was epic in production and length, it failed to grab you and emotionally involve you. Partially, because it looked overly CGI, miscasting that took you out of the scene, inaccurate stories and I'm not even a biblical expert. The Moses and God interactions were unusual. How anyone believes Sigourney Weaver to be of that ethnic heritage, anywhere nearby is beyond me. The production was the highlight but the script was off as well as filled with cliché action scenes. Don't bother."
" God is an asshole
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,7,"Pretty good movie in my opinion. But what I don't get is this a Christian/Jewish movie, or an anti-Christian/Jewish movie? Because Jesus Christ, that Hebrew god is just a major asshole, having him portrayed as a small kid doesn't help, it just makes it worse, like humanity is his plaything.I know the biblical story is pretty rough as well, like many things in the old testament, but they could have done a few things to make god seem a bit more sympathetic. I ended up rooting for the Egyptians at the end as a result."
" Don't listen to the God crowd
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,9,"An excellent film. It was beautifully filmed,acted and written. Christian Bale was a fulfilling choice as moses. Christians seem to be getting upity because it doesn't fit how they see the story. Scott did an amazing job of balancing between making the events seem real and plausible,and even making us wonder if Moses was really talking to God or whether it was his mind, against the events as told in the bible. Original,inspiring and beautiful."
" Let's insult the Christians.
",2017-05-10 00:00:00,1,This is a Hollywood explanation of Moses. I am not a religious person. And even I can see the flaws in this story. You will probably believe more in Justin Beiber than Moses after this story of the Greatest Story Ever Told. But this is the I want to learn Bible Stories with out the Bible and now I have no idea what the story was. In this story where God is a child I was thinking of Oh God with George Burns. This time with the role reverse and the child is God.
" Not The Gladiator, but not that bad either
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,8,"This film can be compared to some of the other ""minor"" historical films by Ridley Scott, particularly Kingdom of Heaven and Robin Hood. Both those movies, in my opinion, were saved thanks to their director's cut editions. Exodus yet didn't get this treatment.I cannot but disagree with anyone who gave a review worse or equal to 6. I have seen far more terrible historical films (300:rise of an empire, for example). What I did feel, was that some parts were missing. I can only guess for example that Sigourney Weaver had more than two scenes in the first place.I really appreciated the two leads: Christian Bale, and Joel Edgerton (even though I do agree that Ramses with blue eyes is rather strange), particularly Bale. It's not that he had a difficult role, but he really could fit the character of Moses, especially with that beard. The film did make me feel sympathy also for Ramses. For certain aspects, his character felt indeed motivated.Let me clarify: this film was not planning on being historically accurate. The only fully accurate things I recall were Ramses fighting at Qadesh, and the mouth opening ritual. Everything else, starting from the pillows, all the way to Abu Simbel being a Temple and not a tomb, were wrong. So don't expect this film to be historically accurate.On the other hand, the film was 85% accurate to the biblical account. Scott is an atheist, but that didn't prevent to the story being told with some religious accuracy. I found intriguing that, from certain points of view, it also lets the skeptical viewers distrust the depiction of the events. Moses could be hallucinating (only him sees the manifestation of God), most of the plagues have a rational explanation delivered by an Egyptian adviser. I personally would like to think that this was intentional. That said, the story was told the way it was written in the Bible, more or less accurately. I believe the criticism the film got for being too flat (something I personally disagree with) came because of that: the original story didn't have long dialogues or descriptions, it simply delivered the plot. Hence, the screenwriters had to figure out how to implement that in a motion picture, rather than figuring out ways to make the story less 'flat'. Some original elements were omitted, e.g. Moses' stammering, or the role of Aaron to the story. It is possible that the original cut had such scenes, but they mist have been deleted, because of time restrains. !aybe, in the future, a director's cut will bring justice to this down rated film. I enjoyed the film. It wasn't an outstanding or a top 250 film. It was an averagely good film, filled with stunning visuals. My actual rating would be of 7.5/10, I've put an 8/10 to balance out the current rating a bit."
" Darling! Moses is on the phone....
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,2,"What, in God's name, was this? Everything reeks of commercial operation without any real thought behind it. Of all the puzzling elements in this bizarre epic, the most inexplicable is Christian Bale as Moses. Not the choice of Christian Bale - commercial operation, remember - no, that I understand, what's inexplicable is his performance. We know now Christian Bale is a great actor. Great. The Fighter alone puts him right up there with some of the best of his generation so why then he's so bad, but so bad here. His Moses is absent. Not a moment of truth, not a moment of real connection. Was he a hostage, performing against his will? That's what I felt, that he didn't want to be there and that alone made me watch the whole film with disdain. What a disheartening experience. I give it a 2 and not a 1 out of respect for the crew, because their work is real and present on the screen."
" They messed with the script
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,1,"Hollywood has done it again! They had a perfectly good script - its called the Bible. Remember the great movie biblical epics? At least they stayed with the story (with some reasonable poetic/artistic licence). This lugubrious 3-D fest is totally unsuitable for Christian children as it messes with the story and there are numerous laughable historical inaccuracies. God is portrayed as a precocious, bad-tempered bossy obese child. Nice.Give this one a miss."
" Potential that was wasted
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,4,"I saw this movie because it had Christian Bale in it. I knew this movie was going to suck but I watched it anyway. For the most part it wasn't that bad. I'm not angry, just disappointed. My least favourite part of the movie was the actor who played God. I swear to Cthulu, I have never wanted to punch someone in the face so much. Also what made me angry was that we never got to see Moses parting the sea. It was his most iconic act in the Bible and I watched this movie partly hoping to see that but no, the sea just magically lowered because God is a serious drama queen.This movie is disappointing but okay if you're bored and just want to kill time."
" Too many holes
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,3,"There are so many holes in this story that surely others can blast it forever, but the best ones are: Moses not only uses his golden sword to be thrown in an Excaliber like style into the Red Sea as his last resort to find a solution..and voila... a tsunami starts to happen....and just after his followers don't believe him and once again debate if it is a good idea to follow this mad man, since he never refers to them as his tribe or people that really believe in him as a leader or profit. Yet the best part is, after getting pummeled by a massive 150 foot tsunami wave...he miraculously survives and nobody comes up to congratulate him in his distressed, bloodied ripped open body condition - but instead...he brushes it off like no big deal..just another day surfing some killer waves dudes, and Ramses also survives with his 50 pound golden necklace still attached. And to make matters even more funny... he tells his brother .. oh by the way.. i have a wife and a kid.. you think its cool they come along for our 40 year trek across the middle east to the promised land? His brother replies. You're married? It is so funny.. making one realize that they have not talked at all or had any connection during the super long walk aka Exodus from Egypt to the Red Sea.. they never once talked about anything and are total strangers. Ridley and his writers surely smoked some good weed to write this garbage that is just so pathetic you truly wonder what made them make this script get approved.. unless maybe.. just maybe there is 2 hours missing on the cutting floor.Too many spoilers to mention besides the total lack of dialogue of any meaning for any of the poor foolish actors that signed up for this hogwash film.. which is even more ruined by a wide array of British blue eyed actors...who make more of a farce of being Egyptians. Not sure where Ridley got the memo that Egyptians have blue eyes yet and all happen to also have British accents.. i mean at least try to hire someone that looks slightly Egyptian... and Paul Aaron with a smeared on self tanner looks so laughable that it is hard to take him serious as Ramses senior adviser. At least John Turturo looked the part but acted like an effeminate moron throughout the film but had more lines than almost any other character.. and poor Joel Edgerton was given no meaningful lines and just looked pathetic..sitting next to his son.. with no servants, maids, or concubines.. and given.. Ramses had over 100 kids.. but no.. he is a dad sitting alone at night watching over his son..truly hysterical, and i will not go into how lame Ridley and his writers make the Egyptian society and their beliefs seem like ignorant fools. And he dares to use some scientific explanation of the plagues as if Ramses advisors at that time had any clue of scientific deductive reasoning for a society that worshiped every animal and astrological symbol and the after life."
" Nice Fantasy
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,1,"I watched Gods of Egypt and it was actually a very nice mythological story with a modern take on it. Then I watched Exodus: Gods and Kings The story is often taken as history with only the bible claiming that Exodus did happen. I dispute this movie as historical, because there is NO historical evidence that Exodus ever happened and that Jews were ever slaves in Egypt. Abrahamic religions have perfected martyrdom and playing the victim card in order to weasel their way into people's lives and take over their essence. Story of Exodus is nothing more than propaganda and any and all religious movies are to be viewed as propaganda and NOT history. It never happened. Anyone taking the bible stories to be true without actual evidence, just because the bible said it is in my opinion a willful ignoramus and is intellectually dishonest.As for Ben Kingsley, he seems to be playing Jew roles very well. The whole movie mediocre if you forget that it is another biblical cow dung put on the big screen."
" Another perspective of Moses - Exodus: Gods and Kings
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,6,"This is biblical story made into a movie. I like it because it seems to be well made. Whether the story is correct I don't know. If producers and directors want to make movies about the bible or Hebrew Torah then why don't they just follow those words written so long ago. From what I remember from the bible this touches on some of the story but strays a lot trying to fill in the feelings of those characters involved. This movie looks good, has a good cast and has a great director and technical staff, but it just doesn't feel like a biblical story. Seems more like the movies made about the Roman Empire or stories set in the B.C. of history. I believe the last movie I saw about Moses was with Charlton Heston as Moses and he seemed to fit the role while Christian Bale does not. Bale did a good job, he just doesn't make me see him as that bible character or any biblical Character. I have to admit that Christian Bale though a good actor did not seem right for Bruce Wayne and his Batman half is covered with the costume so that part was okay. So movie kind of good and follow the bibles for future projects. Why do they keep making bible movies?"
" A huge disappointment because i like ridley scott films.
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,6,"My biggest problem with this film was the script. Sigourney Weaver was wasted, amongst other cast members. One could question having Bale in the leading role, and based on this result with good reason. Unlike Scott's other epic the Kingdom of Heaven, memorable verbal exchanges between the characters, are non existent or any good. Having quality C G I effects simply cannot hold flimsy screenplay together. The story of Moses is a good one, but this is not a patch on the 1955 film, with Heston as Moses, all because Cecil B Demille, was a far better story teller, for the big screen in this instance anyway."
" You Can't Take God Out Of A Religious Story (And Expect People To Like It)
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,1,"I know that stories can have different interpretations. I also know that those interpretations need to be fitted to a screenplay in order to be put up on the big screen. Another thing I know, though, is that you can't take the very soul out of any story (religious or not) and expect it to be any good. That is exactly the problem with ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"".For a basic plot summary, ""Exodus"" tells the story of Moses (Christian Bale), who grows up in the court of an Egyptian Pharoah and befriends Ramses (Joel Edgerton), the future heir to the throne. As the men grow older, however, they begin to have their differences, compounded when Moses discovers his true heritage is not at all what he thought, causing him to be exiled into the very people (the Jews) he once semi-ruled over.The problem with this film is so glaring that there is not talking about anything else until it is exposed: You can't take God of a religious script and expect to make it work. If you are going to adapt the Moses story (whether you believe the events occurred or are a myth), you can't rip its heart out along the way. Moses lead the Israelites out from Egyptian rule due to a series of events culminating in a vision from God (a burning bush) that pushed him over the edge. He didn't have a ""love/hate"" relationship with God, nor was God a ""petulant child"" (like He is portrayed in this film). Moses had his doubts, to be sure, but the overall message is basically that he accepted his role as God's mouthpiece, in a sense, for leading the Israelites back to their homeland.Essentially, Ridley Scott is pulling the same crap here that Darren Aronofsky tried to get away with in ""Noah"". I know that religion can be a touchy issue with many people, but these are movies we are talking about here! The ""Harry Potter"" or ""Lord of the Rings"" stories can be touchy with some people too, yet they aren't pillaged of their material before hitting the big screen. Basically, no studio/director besides Mel Gibson (""The Passion of the Christ"") has the guts to make a religious film the way it needs to be made. By making a film like this that treats God in such a sour light, you are effectively doing two things: 1. Alienating Christians (those who know the story to begin with); and 2. Watering down the story for the rest of us. I don't see how either of those things can help the movie succeed.There really is only one positive thing I can say about ""Exodus"": I like the notion that the plagues upon Egypt had a basis in real-life scenarios (e.g. crocodile feeding frenzy turning the Nile red). I've never been a fan of the image of ""God with his mighty rod smiting things"". I truly believe that God uses natural occurrences to work his miracles, so I liked that. A kernel of something interesting in the midst of dreck.After this film bombs (I can't see any reason it won't), I am no longer being sucked into the ""Hollywood Bible Epic"" hoopla anymore. Until a studio has the guts to tell a Bible story right, I don't want to sit through these terrible interpretations any longer. I had high, high hopes for ""Exodus"" (especially with the casting of Bale), but it ended up being just as bad as Noah (in some ways even worse). I guess old Charlton Heston is still the standard here."
" Utter tedium
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,4,"I'm not religious, but how do you take a story with so much potential and make it boring ?I'm not sure, but they managed it with this film.Despite some big names in the cast, the actors are never really utilised. Ben Kingsley gets an easy pay cheque, and Christian Bale's capable of much more than the script offers.And we never actually see Moses as any kind of leader (except right at the end). He just has the occasional chat with 'God', then doesn't do much else. We see no action or even interaction with the slaves. Closest we get to that is setting some boats on fire.And the plagues of Egypt are dulled down to the point they make no impact.The ending's the worst though. No dramatic parting of the seas, just a leisurely stroll over the seabed.Save your time and watch older versions if you want spectacle, and definitely acting.Honestly, seen more drama and spectacle in some TV documentaries about the subject."
" Ridley Scott has a vision but it just barely enough to redeem this biblical epic from it's sluggish narrative
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,5,"It is nearly impossible to count how many times Hollywood has saw a re-imagining of the story of Moses, with the 1956 entry 'Ten Commandments' starring Charlton Heston being the most acclaimed. Taking from the pages of the Book of Exodus is time is visionary director Ridley Scott who has some fair experience with the epic action genre tracing back 'Gladiator' in 2000 followed 'Kingdom of Heaven' five years later. The director has made an incredible name for himself most often for his firm and atmospheric visual style. And whenever it takes the director's chair, the film is guaranteed to make for an eye-dazzling hit. This biblical epic starring Christian Bale in the lead role however, strays far from his usual filmmaking quality. Translated from the screenplay of four different writers, this big-budgeted epic sees the appealing flair of Ridley Scott's visual compulsion splashing on the screen, but not the narrative to lift it above the level of disposable entertainment. Set in 1300 B.C., this film follows the story of Moses (played by Christian Bale), a fellow Egyptian who witnesses the atrocities of slavery under the brutal ruling the Pharoh King Ramses a.k.a. his brother (played by Joel Edgerton). When he exiled from his home under the order of Queen Taya (played by Sigourney Weaver) upon him discovering his family's Hebrew heritage, Moses rallies Egypt's 600,000 slaves in a rebellion against Ramses in a desperate attempt to lead them to freedom.For an epic held as ""one of the greatest stories ever told"" being handled by a versatile director like Ridley Scott, many would expect this to be a powerful thrill ride if not a groundbreaking spectacle. Unfortunately, the only aspect keeping this biblical epic remotely resembling Ridley Scott's signature grandeur is it's dazzling visual appeal, from the striking production design of Ancient Egypt to the bombastic battle sequences. Demonstrated in the early battle sequence and the giant tsunami sequence, Ridley Scott gracefully shows his fixation for intense, special effects-heavy action set pieces; and they comfortably mark the film's most thrilling aspects. Everything else beyond this leads little be desired. The film explores the trajectory of the Bible's Book of Exodus from Moses's established brotherhood of the tyrant Pharoh King Ramses, to his romance with his wife Zipporah (played by Maria Valverde), to the ten plagues prophesized by God (complete with solid CGI bugs and locusts everywhere), to his climatic journey of leading the 600,000 Egyptians out of slavery. And Ridley Scott takes a daunting task of showcasing this in a 2 1/2 hour runtime, and the results is a story that proceeds at a sluggish pace and falls short of an emotional touch. The story is rarely engaging and more than often, grows tedious with climatic moments coming few and far in between. As the Book of Exodus is an exceptionally long story, it appears Ridley Scott and the writers struggle trying to cram the nearly the entire story into a 150 minutes worth of material.In terms of casting, Ridley Scott makes the controversial (though not uncommon) choice of white washing the roles of Egyptian figures in favor of Caucasian actors. The idea is understandably questionable unless you consider the difficulty of finding quality actors of the Middle Eastern descent. Igniting the role of lead figure Moses is Christian Bale who's portrayal is mostly solid throughout the picture but occasionally slips every now and then; nothing Oscar-worthy or groundbreaking. The character's emotional core comes his questioning his faith in God and his own personal flaws. His portrayal however, manages to take significant liberties from his signature portrayal from the Bible which will predictably raise heat for devout Christian, Catholics, and overall Church-goers. Playing the antagonist role of King Ramses is Joel Edgerton who appears with Egyptian eyeliner and completely shaved head in order to resemble his historical counterpart. His performance is fine, but again nothing special. The best performances the film manages to obtain comes from Ben Kingsley as Nun and 'Alien' veteran Sigourney Weaver as Queen Taya, neither of which get more than ten minutes of screen time sadly. Arguably the film's most bizarre aspect is the story's represent of God as a young lad played by Isaac Andrews. His performance is not necessarily bad, but his interaction with Christian Bale's Moses often plays out more awkward than riveting. In brief words, it is fairly questionable decision to leave viewers scratching their heads.Exodus: Gods and Kings is a sluggish biblical epic that may strive for a solid visual heft but lacks the emotional touch and compelling story to make it interesting. Though it is certainly far from claiming a spot for the worst religious-based picture, it is barely passable and almost instantly forgettable."
