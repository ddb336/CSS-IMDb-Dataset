" Skip it
",2021-04-09 00:00:00,1,"I love i <3 huckabees, Silver Linings Playbook was good, American Hustle was fun, Joy, however, was written by a 4 year old.He must've been drunk the whole time he was writing it, or, perhaps he needed money fast so he wrote it in 2 days... Either way, it was so bad, I actually kept watching it just to laugh at it instead of turning it off."
" Nice film
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,9,"Good film for watch. Specially for entrepreneurs,business related persons."
" Jennifer Lawrence carried the poor directing and editing
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,5,"Actually a really good underlying story here, but the script, directing and editing is so poor, it completely messes it up. The pacing is awful and they imported just about every cliche in the book. It just feels dialled in. Lawrence must have had intense back pain after carrying this movie so hard. With any other actor, this movie would have flopped spectacularly"
" David o russell
",2021-02-08 00:00:00,4,"Uses his white privilege in Hollywood to steal a script written by a woman and put his name as the sole writing credit. Sexist casting choice, got to choose the hot blonde to play the woman whose 10 years older then Lawrence and nothing alike. Just poor on Hollywood and people should be calling out this director for his behaviour"
" Ooo... Why
",2020-11-09 00:00:00,2,"First time I'm writing review
.. this was sooo bad...
Some lady, decided to make a movie, obviously she has enough money.
And here we are.... Movie full of stars ( I'm surprised , what kind of ace's) and at the end of this THING.... I'm still asking why they did this... Was the money, what they offered them to gooood???? Why???"
" Not bad and great performance from Jennifer Lawrence but a bit predicatable
",2020-10-26 00:00:00,7,"Watchable. Jennifer Lawrence is excellent, Bradley Cooper is good but dealing with a not very exciting plot and Mr DeNiro is his often portrayed, grumpy, miserable character so I felt very type cast.
I felt the whole plot was not worthy of such a starry cast."
" Joyous!
",2020-10-12 00:00:00,9,It's a real heartwarmer. Especially great if you're feeling blue.
" Lawrence, yet again, displays her formidable talent and priceless charisma.
",2020-09-29 00:00:00,6,"It's a banana flambé with extra rum that brazenly throws together folksy storytelling, arch soap opera melodrama and a typically eccentric cast into a golden Hollywood crack at the American Dream."
" Uplifting, empowering and unique
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,7,"I must admit, the first half an hour of this film had me almost snoozing but then everything changed...I became really engrossed in Joy's journey and everything and everyone around her. That's what makes a good film.This is a great film to watch if you ever feel the need to be inspired. A little slow, but a great watch"
" Inspiring!
",2020-09-08 00:00:00,9,"While Joy is only partially based on the life of Joy Mangano, it is still hard to not leave the movie inspired.David O. Russell weaves a gripping tale of a single mother who blossoms from the quintessential doormat to a gangster boss lady. Charmingly, all this while she nurtures all her relationships - including with her divorced husband, absent mother, and selfish father.Truly heartwarming while being fast paced - a delightful combination!"
" Not much in the way of joy here!
",2020-08-27 00:00:00,5,"David O. Russell has made some lovely films with Jennifer Lawrence, such as ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and ""American Hustle"". And here, with Lawrence once again, he's given her an excellent role (that resulted in an Oscar nomination) but that's really about all. Unlike the other films, the rest of the characters are so unlikable and nasty that watching the film is akin to pouring salt into your eyes.....it's just not particularly nice nor pleasant. Now the characters in these other films were not exactly nice folks...but you felt compelled to watch them. Not as much here...mostly because these other characters tend to dominate the story instead of accentuating it in ""Joy"".Joy is a character originally envisioned as a biography of real-life Joy Mangano--a woman who invented some labor-saving household items which have made her rich. But as the script was written, the story began to diverge more and more and more from Mangano's life...to the point where it's mostly fiction.In this story, Joy (Lawrence) is the glue that tries to hold her very dysfunctional and chaotic life together. And, it's tough considering that Joy's family has little in the way of boundaries and Joy is working her butt off. For example, her parents divorced long ago...yet the pair moved in with Joy....and bring chaos to her life as they fight AND the parents both bring their boyfriends/girlfriends into the home! The bottom line is that practically everyone in the family makes great demands on Joy and they don't seem to care that this is destroying her. And, frustratingly, Joy is practically incapable of telling any of these jerks no! I think too much of the film focuses on this chaos, as I found myself tense and frustrated watching her life. I just wanted these folks to go away!Eventually, like the real Joy, this Joy manages to take her great ideas and market them...and make money from them. Too bad she didn't use this money and power to get restraining orders to keep everyone from her family out of her life. And, too bad it took so long and we needed to cringe constantly at the family until this breakthrough EVENTUALLY occurred. But even then, the family seems to do their best to make Joy's idea fall flat.The bottom line is that it can be tough to sell a story where you don't like anyone. It can work...but it's an uphill battle...and here it just didn't work well for me. And, I can see why this Russell film didn't do as well in theaters as his other collaborations with Lawrence....making less in the States than it cost to make. As it is, it's watchable but a bit of a disappointment. Slow and not at all a joy to watch! It at least earns a 5 because there are some nice performances. The film MIGHT have worked better had the first half of the movie been reduced significantly and the final portion accentuated further."
" I don't need a prince.. I have a magical power ✨
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,10,"Wait to the end ..
And you will watch a very successful inspirational movie ...about a woman who doesn't need a prince to save her life..
She has a magical power..."
" Knew it was bad from first scene
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,3,"Regardless the story, this movie has a really strange and un-engaging filming style. The music is too loud and interrupts the dialogue, the camera work is off focus sometimes, dialogue is shallow. It's almost like watching a boring theatre show. On top of all, there is no story. They all live together in that house and Joy is the only one taking care of everything, her ex husband and divorced parents living all together? Go figure. And what year is this supposed to be? Old decor and outfits for no good reason. Overall a real weird one."
" Likeable biopic drama
",2020-07-02 00:00:00,6,"The ever winning Lawrence, with some sterling support, in a story that certainly strays into an area and industry seldom covered by Hollywood film. Peters out towards the end, hampered by reality as per all biopics, not withstanding a few cartoonish dramatic flourishes on the way. Almost becoming standard O'Russell fare"
" Joy
",2020-06-20 00:00:00,5,"The Joy of Mopping is lost in a bizarre screenplay which is so unstructured. It keeps going to a soap opera that Joy's bedridden mother keeps watching but then the soap opera element is dropped. The director knows it is not working.David O Russell wanted Joy to be a quirky feminist movie of empowerment.Joy Mangano (Jennifer Lawrence) lives in a dysfunctional household. She is a single mother with her ex husband living in the basement.When Joy has an idea of a self wringing mop. Her father Rudy (Robert De Niro) has some manufacturing knowledge, his latest girlfriend Trudy (Isabella Rossellini) has money to invest.However Joy struggles with her lack of business acumen. She is being fleeced by the manufacturer of her mop, her family give her the wrong advice or make the wrong decisions. Even after the mop proves to be a hit on the shopping channel QVC. Joy is still heavily in debt.A starring vehicle for Jennifer Lawrence, she got an Oscar nomination but she did not wipe the floor on Oscar night. Despite being a strange movie, it is all about a mop that went on to wring its competitors."
" Much better than I expected
",2020-06-17 00:00:00,7,"I should not have been surprised. Jennifer Lawrence is an AMAZING actor, one of the finest we have today. The story is not flashy, but the acting is superb. If you can enjoy movies without a lot of CGI and things blowing up, give this a try."
" Find the OFF Switch!
",2020-06-15 00:00:00,2,"We survived the 1st 15minutes of this, which includes the fact that JOYs mum never leaves her bedroom, watches TV all day, then suddenly someone brings Mr De Niro into the house and says ""he cant stay with me anymore""....queue argument and DeNiro smashing things up to lots of abuse from the lazy mother who still hasnt moved off the bed despite her obvious ""quality attire""......IF THIS is the sort of film that you (a grown adult) want to watch, keep watching.....not for us and NOT for the kids!"
" A little Gem of a movie - a joy to watch, good performances
",2020-06-08 00:00:00,8,"Just sitting around after a late dinner. This movie pops up and after 10 minutes...I'm in. Pointless recounting the story line ( woman takes a bad situation and addresses it with an invention) because the story is brought to you by a superb Director and Lighting Cameraman. What they do is immerse you elegantly, in an elegant story. You will see it to the end, because you really want to. Lawrence is superb and all the cast also step up their game and understand the tone of the script. A movie well-worth investing in."
" Inspiring story with great background scores
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,8,"Joy is a movie about pulling yourself up, when everything else seems to be falling down. It is about determination, that there will always be hurdles in life, you just have to keep pushing hard. Jennifer Lawrence gave a great perfomance. The movie is well written and directed, paired up with amazing background scores. Very sharp cinematography of the scene where she visits QVC for the first time. The only thing, I wish they could have imporved was strech the scene a bit more where she was at the lowest point in her life."
" Joy (2015)
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,7,This is a purely fictionalised film with a unique way of looking at life and in my perspective the film maker establishes a strong performance through external art and craft and also by unique character development.Obviously the film is unrealistic but the humour and dramatic portrayal is an amazing experimentation in cinema on my perspective.
" Joy-less
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,1,"Even with the A list stars in this film, they cannot save this film. It is ironic that a film with its name sake cannot elict any...Joy. It may have been based on a true story but I wish film makers will stop commissioning these types of movie in the hope it will win over people's heart. Maybe this is a visual representation of ""flogging a dead horse""."
" Encouraging and motivating
",2020-04-09 00:00:00,7,"Believing and having the motivation to do what is right. The cameras made it feel personal, the plot, can still be better told. The main character is good as it's actress. Overall, still gives that nice feeling."
" Unexpected Gem
",2020-03-31 00:00:00,8,"I haven't watched a movie that Jennifer Lawrence stars in in a good while and I was pleasantly surprised while watching Joy because she was phenomenal in this. Going in, I had no idea who this movie was based on but at the end of it, I did a quick Google search and I can't believe she actually made it, despite all the internal and external challenges that she faced. It was empowering to see her achieve success after being set back so many times and with minimal support."
" Oh joy!!
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,10,"I give it a 10 out of 10, i truly believe the reviews are underrated possibly because it's percieved as a cliché female empowerment movie- which it is not!. Jennifer Lawrence gave an outstanding performance, Bradley cooper and Robert De Niro are on point. I love this movie!..... I'm a guy tho"
" Russel & Lawrence & De Niro & Cooper Part 1
",2020-03-15 00:00:00,6,"This movie is about the invention of a mop. Sounds boring right? Nope. David O. Russell and Jennifer Lawrence manages to make a story about the invention of a mop super engrossing and fun.A lot of people are disliking Joy and I'm sitting here trying to figure out why. Like Steve Jobs and Straight Outta Compton, Joy isn't your typical biopic. It's energetic, fun, and has a whole lotta heart. Jennifer Lawrence was absolutely fantastic. Her second best performance to date; her best being Silver Linings Playbook. The ensemble cast is great. Even though Cooper and DeNiro don't get a whole lot of screen time, they make the most out of it. Both were excellent.Sure the film is a little messy and it slows down a bit once the third act hits, but that didn't stop me from enjoying the heck out of Joy. 2015 is the year of unconventional biopics and they're all turned out to be excellent."
" A you can do it movie
",2020-02-04 00:00:00,10,"Ive watched this movie several times, i thoroughly enjoy the main characters rise to success upon struggling. I love the depiction of the mum who watches TV all day its perfectly captured and lends some explanation towards Joys somewhat defeated character at times. It's believable, it's interesting, give it a go!"
" IT WAS MORE THAN A MOP
",2019-12-29 00:00:00,10,"This is so much more different than any other David O. Russell film, and I loved it!! It's almost on par to ""SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK"" which today I say is the best David O. Russell film to date in my opinion. Jennifer Lawrence, I think was robbed an Oscar for her amazing performance. Robert De Niro brings a great vibe that gives a good balance Between Jennifer Lawrence's. Bradley Cooper, although doesn't get as much screen time, every minute he has is more than a normal supporting character. Almost every minute of this film can be said as PERFECT. Just so amazing."
" To me this is America.
",2019-12-29 00:00:00,10,"I laughed so hard at this family. Rober deniro, the ex wife, the ex husband and joy the american. It's a great true story buy a fantastic director. I saw it in the cinemas, streamed it and now I've bought it on bluray. This is America, dysfunctional, hardworking with a happy white picket fenced ending."
" Why so underrated?
",2019-12-06 00:00:00,8,"Ok I get if you don't like quirky then this might not be your thing. But this was funny, well acted and heartfelt.
If you like Silver linings playbook it's likely that you'll like this. The plots are totally different but the cast and humour are very similar.
It's really not about the story of how she got to where she did, but the characters are so rich and bizarre this is truly worth a watch. And JLaw nails the performance."
" QVC film in Woman Empowerment perspectives
",2019-11-12 00:00:00,9,JL does a woman enter pioneers role. She has her own ideas of making a new MOP ! Its thread thick innovative idea is really good for mopping. Quality Value and Convenience are 3 marketing principles. New Product BOOM Big investment and withdrawal and betraying partners rivals.... Every thing nicely knitted. How a commercial exploitation is made in talk shows greatly shown. JL does not wear the attractive dress but is comfortable in handling the anchor hard earned spot by Brad C. Rob Nero has little to contribute. But JL does it all fine. Gradually she knows the business and practices very ethically strongly against all Odds one can anticipate. Her female role actually helps her to win the modesty and sympathy from Audience. Little marketing strategy textbook like but gracefully without fun and too much of it ruthlessness displayed much better. A simple MOP made from threads middle sizes can be more aggressively made a topic of town product and may give a good run in business. On this line lot of hardships are also knitted. Un-expected swings of mood in public FMCG Fast moving consumer good psychology very nicely portrayed. Everybody performed modestly and matched the story elements with expected melodrama treats.
" A soporific mess with a shamelessly obvious agenda
",2019-11-09 00:00:00,1,"Despite the fact that I like Lawrence, when Joy was released, I decided to skip it, because the story of the woman who invented the Magic Mop did not seem gripping enough to carry a movie. Fast forward to TV broadcast and I found out that I was right.The plot is your average ""be yourself to overcome all problems"", compounded by an overdose of pseudo-feminism.... and if being oneself was enough to be successful, we'd all be rich and famous.Joy's grandmother narrates the events, adding nothing to the plot, except weirdness. Joy was a creative child, but her parents' divorce damaged her and she took years to recover, gathering a failed marriage and two children on the way. Joy is presently encumbered (and blessed?) by her family of weirdoes, inclusive of ex-hubbyTony, living in her basement and serial monogamist daddy Rudy, embarking in yet another relationship with wealthy Italian Trudy.Her sparkle of genius comes about when she is forced to mop a broken glass from the floor, cutting her hands to squeeze the mop. A normal person would swipe the glass away before mopping, but in Joy's case, this prompted the creation of the Magic Mop.What follow is a messy start of a business enterprise, in which every member of her dysfunctional family gets involved, giving advice ranging from reasonable to extremely bad.Probably, not many would be interested in the story of how the pencil sharpener came to be, especially if the inventor was a man. In this case, since we're dealing with a female entrepreneur at the time of the #metoo, we're all supposed to root for Joy.Unfortunately, the script is extremely loose, some characters are totally useless (Joy's mother), other plain cliche (the evil step-sister). The strength of female bonding is overplayed (Joy and her BFF and her daughter and her grandmother) while heterosexual romance goes straight to the bin (failed relationship all over the place) to underline Joy's independence.I always found it difficult to enjoy a movie with an shameless agenda and this is no exception."
" It's the perfect movie for whoever wants to run a business!
",2019-10-15 00:00:00,10,"At first I thought that this movie was something between nice and chill movie. But then, the plot got so interesting and so motivational that it really gave me chills!!
It's the perfect movie for whoever wants to run a business! Besides I love Jennifer Lawrence!"
" A rags to riches story that never really grabbed me
",2019-10-11 00:00:00,7,"Joy is a bio-pic of entrepreneur Joy Magano, a divorced mother of two who risks her life savings to create the miracle mop. The success of that product leads to a home shopping empire and her rise to the matriarch of her family business dynasty.It was pretty good, Jennifer Lawrence is always a treat so watch on screen, she is so compelling, but if I'm honest this was also kinda meh. A rags to riches story that never really grabbed me. It just wasn't compelling and dragged at times with very little character development. I always felt like this could have been more than it was showing. The A-list cast doesn't even help move things along. There is also some weird soap opera stuff here that went on way too long including Susan Lucci and Donna Mills from the view of her shut in mother."
" Manganos Marvelous Mop
",2019-09-09 00:00:00,7,"MMM mop- Its a story about one womans obsession for perfect mop yes i said mop and i think its a true story about Joy Mangano how she invented those mops that self ring out and made 60million dollar. Its crazy how a fim about a mop was sold with an inventers first name it would be like a Ford car movie called ""Henry""."
" Ooo, strong women strike again
",2019-08-20 00:00:00,7,"But Jenifer Lawrence still plays well, in her opinion."
" Wow, just wow!
",2019-08-18 00:00:00,10,"It's rare that I happen upon a gem like this. Boy, this was not only moving, but inspirational. What an all star cast and so perfectly acted. The story itself was portrayed with perfection and the direction was impeccable. Kudos Mr. Russell. You have created another masterpiece with this. I could really feel every emotion in this film. It also illuminated primary human flaws and strengths. But, let me clearly point out the reason this movie was a hit for me. Jennifer Lawrence knocked it out of the park. Not sure another actress could have pulled off this role. Thanks for creating this movie to anyone involved. Honestly, the ONLY reason this is not a 10/10 is because it's long and smart and really not as many people can even understand the complexities of the story. It's geared for a certain type of audience. I'd say a must see for all young girls and women. Don't write many reviews. I did for this one."
" Honoring Jennifer Lawerence's 29th birthday again and damn this movie is great!
",2019-08-16 00:00:00,9,"Only seen Joy once before this cause I bought it on iTunes a few years ago and happily watching again because Jennifer is perfection! She deserves everything good in her life and so does the Director David O. Russell! Great story about Joy inventing the best mop ever while having family complications meanwhile trying to be successful.So well filmed even if it sometimes keeps your attention at bay. This is the kind of movie that deserves award nods even if it doesn't achieve them, in my eyes it's a spectacular drama! I also wanna mention its got one of the slickest soundtracks; I love this movie for what it is!!"
" Jennifer Lawrence sold me.
",2019-07-30 00:00:00,7,"Joy is a good film, not a great one. Resting solely on Lawrence's acting prowess.She's a wonderful actress, the manic family situation and her homely demeanor is the film's strength. Joy's parents are messed up. De Niro plays the a-hole father, with a few comedic moments. Ramirez's decent as the ex-husband, he was good in ""Gold"" too. Based on a true story, a fairly dull one. The film doesn't succeed in what it's trying to do, as it's better before Joy starts advertising, where it should really become weightier."
" Really inspiring and realistic!
",2019-07-30 00:00:00,9,"I liked everything about this movie, the story, the acting, I think that this was the best role played by Jennifer Lawrence -maybe after (Silver Linings). The details of her family's life since she was young were really effective.
If you like real inspiring success movies you should see it!"
" A top-notch cast make the story of a woman who invented a new mop gripping
",2019-05-28 00:00:00,9,"This film tells the story of Joy Mangano, When she was younger she was top of her class at school but now she is a single mother of two whose mother, grandmother and ex-husband live share her house. Then one day, after cutting her hand wringing a mop that she'd used after a glass of wine was dropped she came up with a revolutionary idea... a super-absorbent mop that features a wringing mechanism and washable head. With the help of her father's wealthy new girlfriend she deals with a possibly patent conflict and goes into production. At first she can't get anybody to buy the product but following an appearance on the QVC shopping channel orders flood in. This isn't the great success she hoped for though; she must fund the production and then makers of a key part raise their prices... things are about to get tough for Joy.I must be honest; if I'd just read a synopsis of the film without knowing who was in it I'd have rejected it as a subject for an afternoon made-for-TV movie... perhaps in other hands it would have been but a top notch cast and director David O. Russell make it surprisingly gripping. Jennifer Lawrence goes a great job as the eponymous Joy; making her character an ordinary person viewers can empathise with. There is fine support from Robert De Niro, Isabella Rossellini, Virginia Madsen and Bradley Cooper. The story is told at a good pace and concentrates on Joy's struggles at home and to get her mop sold without added any unnecessary hints at romance. Overall I'd definitely recommend this film; especially if you are a fan of Jennifer Lawrence's work."
" Inspirational and invigorating
",2019-04-24 00:00:00,7,"I confess an approach with a negative a priori. Having not really enjoyed Happiness Therapy (David O. Russell, 2012), I feared a film gathering the same director with the same main actors. And I was definitely wrong! First, Jennifer Lawrence plays admirably, and is excellently assisted by Robert De Niro, Bradley Cooper, Edgar Ramirez, Diane Ladd, Virginia Madsen and Isabella Rossellini. This film is also a fabulous and inspirational advocacy to an escape attempt from a disadvantaged environment filled with zombies (the mother Terry in particular, and the father Rudy to a lesser extent) thanks to an obstinacy skilfully measured out and the wise help of her former husband Tony. This movie is invigorating!"
" Attention: All Inventors
",2019-04-14 00:00:00,4,"VERY INSPIRATIONAL: A great movie for any would-be inventors. A little slow, but well-worth the time."
" Ugh
",2019-03-30 00:00:00,2,Unlikable broad with a dysfunctional family gets rich.It's a complete borefest.
" Amazing biopic with stellar performance by J-Law
",2019-02-24 00:00:00,10,"Edit: March 28, 2021My original review was posted some time ago when I originally saw this film, and I had given it an 8/10 for the reasons I stated below. Some time later I saw it again on basic cable TV and was even more impressed, so I upped my rating to a 9/10.Since then I've seen it at least two more times on basic cable TV playing on a Sunday afternoon with nothing else to watch. I've picked up on so much more every time I watch it. I feel the monotonic demeanor of the characters I originally had an issue with must be how the real life Joy and Neil are. Either way, it doesn't matter.I have now given this film a perfect 10/10. It is flawless. It is the epitome of probably the best, and most accurate vastness of family dynamics I have ever seen. The many conflicts in a very realistic household, all played exceptionally in their roles as an unsupportive father, his rich snobby girlfriend, the jealous stepsister, the simplistic mother, the supporting grandmother, the caring ex, and her children. I truly felt Joy's anxiety and pain. J-Law nailed it. Those dynamics and conflicts alone can make an entire TV series, and/or some type of a college psychology class study handbook.Then there's the American dream - and nightmare, perfectly set and played out, and the bonus that it's a real story. Wow. That alone can be a business school study and/or a manual. Even as material for law students.This film is so much more than what I initially thought, and clearly not what most viewers and critics thought. Watch it again, I'm sure you will agree. 10/10.Original review:Amazing biopic with stellar performance by J-Law! Excellent directing, writing, and especially casting - great performances by all! A little slowly paced and not sure if the characters were intentionally supposed to be a little bland - as in the real life, but still a very enjoyable film. Everyone needs to see this biopic. The moral of the story: never give up! It's a well deserved 8/10 from me."
" Good but not great
",2019-02-13 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed this movie so much that I was actually super annoyed when it ended. I don't think I've ever said that about a movie before. Perhaps that is a flaw in the movie that I was wanting more and was super dissatisfied with how quickly it was over? But the acting was phenomenal and the storyline was amazing. If the whole premise was about her becoming a matriarchal heiress, why was that just the summary?"
" Triumph of capitalism and capitalist feminism?
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,3,"While this movie had good acting the message was another sort of pull yourselves up by your bootstraps as the main character, Joy, enjoys newfound wealth and privilege. Having that as a premise of a movie is as capitalist as you get.Perhaps there is more to say about this film. Possibly Jennifer Lawrence, playing Joy Mangano, does a good job in terms of her acting. But is it any surprise that this film brought in mixed reviews? I would say not at all. This film is, clearly, inherently flawed for reasons I have already noted.Without wasting anymore time on this review, it only makes sense to move onto another film that is rated higher than this one, a 3 out of 10."
" Bizarre and somewhat unpleasant to watch
",2018-12-28 00:00:00,6,"The first half of Joy is bizarre and somewhat unpleasant to watch. I don't know if the filmmakers are intentionally trying to be off-putting or if it's just an artistic misfire, but if you can make it through that part, the last half is actually pretty good. Jennifer Lawrence once again proves that she can really act when given the right material. However, I can see why this movie didn't do better with audiences."
" A Woman, Her Mop, Her Vision
",2018-12-24 00:00:00,8,"(Flash Review)""It's only a mop. Only a mop! Only a mop....you don't understand."" Nope, this is not a spin-off of Stanley Spadowski from UHF. HaHa. This is quite the opposite and is about a housewife with a stressful life, dramatic, dysfunctional and unsupportive family dynamics with financial difficulties who invents a new self-wringing and more absorbent mop that can be washed in a washing machine. She makes a risky investment after she meets a buyer from QVC (live television selling channel). Will the mops sell like hotcakes? What other struggles will she face trying to make a profit. This was a well-produced film with great acting, good cinematography and a unique and emotional story with a strong female lead. It was paced well and while it had good depth to most scenes, I felt the ending was rushed or crammed in. Well worth the time."
" Great Business Flick: Joy
",2018-12-07 00:00:00,7,"If you liked Wall Street, and There Will Be Blood, you will probably like this film as well. Jennifer Lawrence's characterization is compelling; however, her family is not. Her best friend is dependable, but not really anyone else in her family except her daughter. Her father, Robert De Niro, is in a role similar to the one he played in Being Flynn, a dysfunctional father seeking a place to stay with an offspring. He is not as good in this film as he was in Being Flynn. The rest of the cast is fine, but it is really not the family scenes that drive this movie; it is the business sequences. The film is like a stock market chart that starts rising gradually, and then suddenly spikes wildly up and down and then back up again. All of these spikes are caused by business-related episodes, some of which are absolutely stunning, and well done by the director. The film bogs down in the family scenes, and spikes in the business scenes. Clearly, the story yearns to be more of a business film than a dysfunctional family film. Luckily, the writer came to this same conclusion and we get a substantial number of good business scenes. Several of the family characterizations are minimal, at best, and are not as deeply explored as Joy. But this is probably a good thing, as the rest of the family is just not as interesting as Joy. A good film to be enjoyed more for its business revelations than insights on how to deal with a dysfunctional family."
" One of the best movies I've ever watched
",2018-11-30 00:00:00,10,"Simply one of the best movies I've ever watched, with a deep and touching script and amazing performances by a team of sensational actors. Super underrated."
" a bio about the woman who reinvented the mop
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,10,Review: I loved this movie because it shows you that with hard work and dedication you can achieve almost anything. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" Stunning performance by Jennifer Lawrence
",2018-11-17 00:00:00,8,"The strength her character embodied was deeply inspiring, and deeply moving."
" Pleasantly Surprised
",2018-11-08 00:00:00,8,"Well here is another Jennifer Lawrence film that I loved. At the beginning of the film, it starts a bit slow but then gets quite good. Jennifer Lawrence plays a character based on a real life woman who became very successful with a mop and other products. I think her and Bradley Cooper work great together. He plays the QVC boss who promotes Joy's mop. I think the movie really shows what a person is capable of when they don't give up! I recommend this film and would definitely watch it again!"
" Ruined by a schlock overload
",2018-11-06 00:00:00,3,"I saw this on (UK) TV without knowing much about it, so expected it to be some kind of hopefully enjoyable light comedy. I soon realised I had it completely wrong. Even when I'd adjusted to its eventual tone, it was if there were several dirctors in control of different scenes, with each vying for dominance. At its best it was reasonably engaging but at its worst it was dreadful beyond belief.Most UK viewers will be aware of a TV series called Episodes, where two UK script writers are initially greeted enthusiastically by the film studio, but the crass movie moguls who only have an eye for a fast buck, gradually start interfering until what started out as a decent script is comprehensively trashed. That is exactly what seems to have happened here, although in that case I'm surprised that the director agreed to keep his name on it.I can let go the highly unsubtle allusions to 'the American dream', but how can anybody forgive the recently deceased Mimi taking over the narration and appearing at her own funeral? To say this was embarrasingly crass and cheesy would be a massive understatement; this was surely one of the great movie mistakes of all time and in those few minutes, the film lost any remaining credibility that it had remaining.If this really was due to intervention by the studio, all those concerned should hang their heads in shame. If the director actually went along with it willingly, he has a fine future ahead of him directing ads for funeral insurance and donkey sanctuaries.I haven't marked this review as containing spoilers, because the makers got there first."
" Beautiful.
",2018-08-15 00:00:00,10,Thoroughly enjoyed it. Beautifully written & feel good feeling
" Plain Awful!
",2018-04-28 00:00:00,2,"This movie is probably one of the worst movies of the year. First of all Jennifer Lawrence was totally miscast, she is too young to play this part. The writing was awful. I know it's based on a true story but oddly enough the story line makes no sense at all. In other words it's a very bad movie."
" Strange, witty story. Sparkles brightly. Jennifer Lawrence is lovely chaotic as usual...
",2018-04-26 00:00:00,8,"Director David O Russel made a sparkling bright movie about an ordinary selfwringing mob. In between this invention story Jennifer Lawrence has to endure the constant bickering fights of her family, who is somewhat weird, to say the least. But she receives a lot of love and support as well from them.""Joy"" sparkles so brightly, despite being such an unromantic story. It still has got a christmas feel good touch to it near the end, although it has nothing to do with a regular christmas movie. What matters most though is that Jennifer Lawrence really comes to life as a character in this selfmade succes story. Jennifer really shines. She is so endearing and loveable. Jennifer carries this movie.All the actors deserve praise though. Just like in ANY David O Russel movie. David O Russel knows that a movie will succeed or fail with the right choice of actors. And he knows how to direct them. That is where the David O Russel's magic becomes visible. He knows how to direct these actors in a way that a dead end story about a selfwringing mob can become a glorious and witty succes story. Very loveable. Not as great as ""Silver Lining Playbook"" and not as great as ""American Hustle"", because there is no real romance in this flick. The bond with friends, family and with work is the substitute for the usual romance found in other O Russel movies. It works out fine though, but I wont give it the huge praise other O Russel movies did get. Although ""Joy"" has become a gem that I CHERISH, because of the rather unusual story and because of the ever present magic charm of David O Russel!"
" A Joy to see
",2018-03-24 00:00:00,8,"Jennifer is sooo good looking. She gets to look a bit gritty, determined and kick ass also here. She's like this beautiful, sweet thing we don't take too seriously that then grabs you by surprise. The film is lightly made, hilarious at times, on a dramatic theme that goes up and down more and more until the climax. I loved it in spite of the bubble gum treatment."
" This is a film about a mop. That is all you need to know.
",2018-03-08 00:00:00,4,"Oh christ this film is boring.
About 30 minutes in I asked my partner when was anything going to start happening and he responded with 'I don't think it is one of those films where anything really does happen'. And he was pretty much right.Firstly, this film is about a lady who invents a new type of mop. I didn't know this before I started watching but I'm quite sure that if I had known this fact I wouldn't of bothered watching it. Let me repeat that - this film centers around the invention of a new type of mop. Yes. A mop. A mop for cleaning floors. If you like rather mundane cliched films about mops then you will love this. In the film's defense, Jennifer Lawrence was fantastic, as was De Niro (obvs) but the story simply wasn't interesting or exciting enough for such a long film - it reminded me of one of those afternoon movies on Channel 5 (UK). This film kind of reminded me of another recent film (also staring De Niro) - The Intern - which, although it wasn't an amazing film, it definitely brought me more joy than 'Joy' did.I try to find something positive in everything, even if I don't like it, so I'll give a special mention to the costume designers. I liked the costumes. There you go. That was the joy I took from this film. Pretty dresses."
" Forty minutes too long
",2018-02-10 00:00:00,2,"Jennifer Lawrence, Edgar Ramirez and Bradley Cooper put in creditable performances. However, the scenes with Robert de Niro and Isabella Rossellini, especially one involving a document signing are poor and contribute to making what good have been a good movie irritating and disjointed. The issues relating to patents were handled in a clumsy and half-hearted way and this could have been played out with more intelligence and intrigue."
" Outstanding in dealing with issues of self worth and confidence
",2018-01-29 00:00:00,10,"Joy, the protagonist of the film carries the other characters when they can't make things work. She makes things work for all of them and us. This process is refreshingly unique in that she constantly thinks on her feet and resolves situations with surprising results. The suspense of the plot allows the audience to be involved in not only her journey but those of her family as well. Encouraging everyone to reach out for that special gift."
" Joyful
",2018-01-04 00:00:00,8,I really enjoyed this movie Im not one for Lawrence but i am starting to like her for a good actress. Good inspirational story to reach for your passion against all odds :-)
" Less than the sum of its parts
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,5,"Russell's films have always teetered between eccentricity and storytelling, but the balance was off here. There's a compelling protagonist and plot, but somehow we're spending all our time on random conversations with quirky supporting characters. The humor and soundtrack say Russell, but the flow is missing. Lawrence (and the cast) almost make it work...almost. But I never really managed to care. That's not about the substance; that's about the storytelling."
" I don't need a prince
",2017-12-18 00:00:00,10,"This is a film inspired by the life of Joy Mangano (Jennifer Lawrence). It is narrated by her grandmother (Diane Ladd) who always had high hopes for her. Joy had dreams and was very creative, but life happened. Like the cicada she reads about, her life took a 17 year hiatus. Her younger self gives Joy an epiphany in a dream. She was going to create. With the help of her family/friends/extended family/near family, for better or worse, she embarked on manufacturing and making the miracle mop and all the trials and tribulations to get it to market.The success of her career is told as an addendum. An academy award winning cast took a simple life story and made it exciting...as well as the added Hollywood dramatization.Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Spoiler: Jennifer Lawrence and Bradly Cooper do not play lovers in this film."
" Works because of Jennifer Lawrence
",2017-11-30 00:00:00,8,Joy is the story of a strong woman that fights against all odds and wins. The success story of an underdog has been done to death. Joy works because it is a real story and it works because it has Jennifer Lawrence in it. It is the story of a woman that believes in her dream and does everything she can to make it possible. Joy inspires people to follow their dream. Her story helps those people who are slightly scared to take a leap. She comes across as identifiable. Jennifer Lawrence does a great job as a common woman and she looks gorgeous.
" Lawrence is great, same does not go for the movie
",2017-09-30 00:00:00,6,"I'll just try to be simple and clear.Jennifer Lawrence did an outstanding job in her leading role, once again. But it's definitely hard to say the same thing for the movie itself.I think it has the right and perfect idea to film but it's is mediocre that even an actor like Robert De Niro seems to be extinguished.If you're either a Jennifer Lawrence fan or you just like her acting, you should watch it. Otherwise, there's no need to waste your time."
" Prime J-Law; shame the other characters are so awful
",2017-09-30 00:00:00,6,"Jennifer Lawrence plays Joy, a beleaguered housewife/TSA agent who invents a self-wringing mop and successfully promotes it on the newly hatched QVC network. This success is despite the relentless stress of having divorced/estranged parents, an ex-husband, two children, and her grandmother all living under her roof and each with his or her own selfish peculiarities. Well, maybe not kindly grandma, who narrates the story.See, first there's dad Rudy (Robert DeNiro), who's just been kicked out of his current wife's (or girlfriend's, not sure) house – ""I'm done with him – you can have him back"" – and who owns and operates a repair shop that happens to have a gun range. Rudy's the sort of guy who rubs just about everyone the wrong way, but of course Joy puts up with his shenanigans. Then there's mom Terry (an unrecognizable Virginia Madsen), who spends almost all of her time in her room watching her stories and flushing her hair down the toilet, which inevitably clogs. There's passionate ex Tony (Edgar Ramirez), who has a good heart if a lack of direction and who lives in the basement. And there's grandmother Mimi (Diane Ladd), who seems to be the only sensible, nurturing person in the house. There's also Joy's half-sister Peggy (Elisabeth Rohm), who doesn't live on the premises but may as well – and she herself has sort of a passive-aggressive love-hate relationship with the ironically named Joy.Aggravating family aside, Joy – a longtime lover of creating things – stumbles upon the need for the aforementioned mop. Up until then, mop heads were permanently attached to the mop handle and couldn't be cleaned without the user touching the nasty thing. Joy discovers that winding a single strand of wool hundreds of times around a base, the mop head not only becomes more absorbent it also becomes easily detached. One can put it in the washing machine! One won't need to buy a new mop every few months! This discovery leads to much success and with it the downsides of running a business – particularly when the business involves your quirky family as well as Dad's new girlfriend, Trudy (Isabella Rossellini), who invests heavily in Joy's venture. Lot of people to please. Lot of potential for things to go wrong, too, when one is a novice in the world of business.(I don't even want to get into Bradley Cooper's character, the head of programming at QVC. Cooper is a little too subtle in his role, almost the point of invisibility. Talk about underwhelming.) Okay, enough plot exposition. Lawrence is winning as always and, in fact, elevates her character with more sincerity and moxie than the script allows. But she's about the only actor who does a lot with flimsy material. DeNiro's character is overbearing and obnoxious; Rossellini's even more so. Joy's rotten half-sister comes off as devious, resentful, and despicable, but prior to Joy's success there was no hint of acrimony. I get it, she's jealous of the success, but there's nothing to back up the attitude. Those characters all feel like they should be in a much broader film, not a character study. In other words, the tone adopted by them is at odds with that adopted by Joy; the two types clash, rather than contrast.Joy is a sufficiently entertaining movie, and it's almost entirely due to Lawrence's strong performance. Director David O. Russell, who also co-wrote the script, has done better."
" Chutzpah...
",2017-09-05 00:00:00,6,"She asks her father for a favour... and it isn't even HIS money! She only sells to begin with because a friend manufactures a call to ease her into her spiel, and she blames her sister because the parts makers overcharge... I don't know about innovation, but all those things definitely take some big, brass balls! All of her success with the WonderMop is down to other people's sacrifices.It's kind of a dispiriting message, if what it tells us is people with this kind of chutzpah are the only ones who ever really succeed in business, even when they're ordinary... You look at the details, and there's not much cause for elation, at all...There's certainly something to be said for a wipe-clean sense of shame, though!"
" A story of a matriarch who managed to run her own business from the scratch. It was all a matter of paper, crayons and the idea of a special lop changed her life.
",2017-08-22 00:00:00,7,"In general Joy was a good movie but not for those who love action and plot twists.The movie is all about fulfilling dreams and ambitions and gives the idea that we should never get disappointed because in the end there is always a solution. Another important message that can be drawn from this movie is that we can always attain our goals any time we want it.Its all a matter of decision, self- commitment and devotion.It seems after all that everything even happiness is in our minds. It is a movie that will fill you with positive feelings and optimism but still the plot was somehow predictable."
" More than I was expecting
",2017-08-20 00:00:00,7,I was not drawn to Joy when it was first released because it just looked like a made for TV movie. I was surprised when Jennifer Lawrence was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance and still had no real desire to see Joy. Joy popped up on my new releases list on Apple TV today so I thought I would just watch the first 10 minutes to get an idea whether it would be watching or not. After 10 minutes I knew this was worth watching so my husband and I watched it and to both of our surprise we really liked it. Jennifer Lawrence was outstanding in her role as Joy. I've always thought Lawrence was an amazing actress since I saw her in Winter's Bone. She is the real deal. She is destined for more success with each film she is in. DeNiro is amazing as always. It is a wonderful story that should have received better reviews. I can understand why it wasn't a box office hit but it is definitely worth watching.
" Inspiring movie
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,8,Lol.I guess you have to be slightly more sensitive than a brick to get this movie. I was relatively bored at the start and came close to switching it off but it developed into a very emotionally satisfying and inspiring movie mainly thanks to the performance of the lead actress and the character who never did give up. I don't care if it is fictional. Maybe there were so many bad reviews because she didn't see herself as a victim. Haters always gonna hate.
" Strong performance excels from Jennifer Lawrence
",2017-07-05 00:00:00,8,"Joy may have been considered somewhat of a disappointment and letdown compared to David O'Russell's latest films of these decade. It did not receive as much praise or box office revenue as his other films, as well as Oscar nominations, although the film may be underrated in general (Though Jennifer Lawrence did receive a nomination). Not as a great as Silver Lining Playbook and a completely different film in comparison to the Fighter and American Hustle, though Joy once again delivers a very good movie due to the performance of Jennifer Lawrence. This is a film in where the lead was needed to deliver a strong performance since this is her film as she is in about every scene and she is the complete main focus. It works because she is playing a strong independent role where we are rooting for her, as we see her struggle and everyday chaos at her household. Unlike O'Russell's other films, the story may not be as interesting and entertaining but the more the film goes, the better it becomes and the more we are intrigued in where it is heading. Seeing as it is based on a true story, where a rags to riches tale, the subplots and scenes involving Joy's dysfunctional family are some of the best. The film features Bradley Cooper but in a much smaller role where he isn't in the film for the first half, though once he gets introduced, the film arguably becomes greater as it centers more towards Joy's invention and the stakes it takes in wanting to be great, where the first half was an introduction to her family. Also delivered by a great performance from Robert De Niro as her father, David O'Russell is able to get another solid performance from him. Perhaps something was missing from the film, it is an entertaining watch but in comparison to SLP, it is noticeably weaker."
" A grandmother and a best friend in this movie made me cry
",2017-06-28 00:00:00,10,"The life story of the self-wringing-mop inventor. A story of a cool headed woman kept doing what she could in her messy life and messy family and beyond. I was broken hearted (seriously that bad) 4 times in watching this movie once. When u are really almost there and the world wards you, crushes you, grinds you, pulling you down hard..... The grandmother, oh I love her so much! She never lost, never stopped her faith on this granddaughter (not everyone has this kind of person in his/ her life I think). She just knew it, that this one girl would nail it someday, and be the family savior. And the best friend, oh! I love her so much too! Only a true best friend can really know how to help you like she did to the main character here!! And this tough movie is presented prettily. So blessed. IMDb rate of this today 28-Jun-2017 is 6.6, my rate is 9.9."
" A Messy Life, So, She Mopped the Floor.
",2017-06-10 00:00:00,8,"""...it is equally possible that she is a fatally flawed underachiever, doomed to a lifetime of failure, disappointment, unfulfilled expectations"".I get why this movie has a 60% rating from audience and critics alike, however, something too great to ignore resonated with me, amid the film's irregularities and foolishness. Lines like the one above, in conjunction with it's somewhat uncommon approach, somehow melded well with me, and spoke to me.Yeah sure, there are things in this movie that just have you questioning, how or why; like Todd's mistake on live television. Why and how do you go on live television to sell a product you aren't as familiar with as you should be, then as a professional TV personality, handle that situation so appallingly? Trudy, poor, poor Trudy. It was just supposed to be a date with the old man. However, within all these ""whys"", I felt myself also asking; Why not?!Perhaps if this film wasn't based on true events, it would seem a bit too far fetched and disingenuous, but it was. True, being a bio is no licence to warp reality, but personally, I feel Joy captured enough actual real life realism and chaos, while not losing sight of the entertainment factor, and still remaining adequately inspirational enough, to warrant at least a messy 7.8/10...But, that is what the mop was made for; to absorb the mess, and expose the cleanliness buried underneath. Joy's life was a mess, so she mopped the floor clean with competition."
" A movie for dreamers
",2017-06-02 00:00:00,9,"Joy is the story of the title character, who rose to become founder and matriarch of a powerful family business dynasty.I must admit I wasn't really interested in this film in the beginning the joy and trailer didn't make this film sound that interesting. I ended up finding a copy of it and decided to give it ago, I was so impressed with what I saw. David O. Russell has crafted a really fascinating and special film. It is a film about strength and perseverance fighting for what you want and never giving up until you get it. It really feels like a fairy tale, Joy's grandmother narrates the story, it reminded me of a Cinderella story or Wizard of OZ, it has a magical quality to it. It looks at how as children we have dreams of what we want to be or do when we grow up, then life happens and we forget what it was we original wanted. Everyone does a great job here, Jennifer Lawrence really carries the movie you really feel for her and the situations her family put her in. I feel she really deserved her Oscar Nomination for this role. I felt really inspired after watching this."
" Well, it was riveting!
",2017-05-13 00:00:00,9,"What the f is wrong with you guys? This is a MOVIE. Movies and CHARACTERS are supposed to be PORTRAYALS of real incidents and people. And the REASON why us-- the real people-- go to the movies is because the people who make these movies make real life look better, MORE dramatic, more interesting, more cinematic! If we wanted pure realism, we would LIVE among these troubled and argumentative characters, live the desperate lives of the main characters with no happy ending in sight! But of course nobody wants that. We go to the movies to see realistic situations LIFTED from real life to be tweaked so that real life could seem tolerable. All the actors did a great job! Even De Niro and Rosellini were convincingly so annoying. It may not be an extraordinary plot, but the pacing and the continuity was great. It's not supposed to be a heavy drama, people, even though the lead character went through a wringer in her life, nor is it supposed to be a comedy either. It's a well-balanced storytelling of life. Jeez..."
" So Underrated
",2017-05-10 00:00:00,8,"probably one of the best films of 2015 Miss, Lawrence delivered one of her most powerful performance to the screen, and even though she won an Oscar for (Silver Linings Playbook 2012) her performance here is much more powerful. she bring a very hard combination of both comedy and tragedy that no other actress can bring to the screen, and i must give a big thanks to David O. Russell who gave Jennifer three Academy Award nomination for three movie they worked together ( SLP 2012, AH 2013, and this film).There're so many critics criticized the film by saying that all the rest of the cast are so weak or unnecessary and any other unknown actors could do there job, which i totally disagree with. yes the role of other actors are not as the size of Joy's role and that's for a reason ( because she is the center of the whole story), but all of them give a brilliant job. Robert De Niro was amazing in his small role and gave us a couple of funny scenes such as the wedding, and the fighting scene between him and Virginia Madsen ( his ex- wife) which also was so good and funny even though most of her scenes were made in one room the bedroom.Also the grandmother role (Diane Ladd ) which also was the narrator of the whole film was very powerful to the whole film, because she was the the person who encouraged joy to become a important person in this world."
" Very well acted
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,7,"Joy is based off of a true story about a woman who invents a mop unlike any other ever produced before and tries desperately to get it on the market. This woman is played by Jennifer Lawrence. Lawrence plays her wonderfully, very raw and skillful performance. We get similar performances from the rest of the cast. Robert De Niro gives a great performance that is sometimes pretty explosive, his character is kind of polarizing. But if anyone can play it well it's De Niro. Virginia Madsen is also here, she plays the ex wife of Robert De Niro and the mother of Jennifer Lawrence. Madsen is one of my favorite actresses and she doesn't disappoint here, her character is sort of reclusive in a way. Isabella Rossellini (death becomes her) plays a woman De Niro is seeing and helps Lawrence in trying to get her invention up and running. The script isn't the greatest ever, nor is it poor, I'd say it's a little above average. It's true that Joy isn't the best film Lawrence has ever starred in, but it's still worth a watch, I suggest Joy for anyone who is a fan of the cast members. I give Joy a 7 out of 10."
" The film was good. The haters don't know anything.
",2017-03-10 00:00:00,9,"The plot is simple, a Woman who has never made something of herself and has never managed money correctly breaks through the barriers of a dysfunctional family and financial situation to reach her ultimate goal.Some of you should actually watch and pay attention to a film before you review it on IMDb."
" Russell Crosses The Line From ""Quirky"" To Just Plain ""Weird""
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,4,"There is no doubt that film director David O. Russell has a very unique cinematic vision. He actually started off (at least in his major films) with the pretty straight-laced ""The Fighter"", but then ""Silver Lining's Playbook"" was a bit kooky and ""American Hustle"" even more madcap. While I liked all three of those films, I liked each of them a little bit less than their predecessor because I felt the great story of each picture was getting more and more covered up by the wild storytelling techniques. With ""Joy"", that jump was even more pronounced, to the point where I struggled to even enjoy the experience at times.For a basic plot summary, ""Joy"" tells the story of, well, Joy (Jennifer Lawrence), a woman who is unhappy with her life. Joy was always a dreamer and creator as a child, but both her mother (Virginia Madsen) and her father (Robert De Niro) are too caught up in their own life drama to give her much heed. As a young adult, Joy is practically the provider for and organizer of the entire family, but she decides she wants more. So, after a nasty glass-cutting-hands accident on a boating excursion, Joy sets her mind toward inventing and selling a self-wringing mop. During this journey she meets Neil Walker (Bradley Cooper), who introduces her to the concept of selling her productions on TV (QVC). Will Joy fail in the face of big business obstacles, or will she persevere? That is what the film builds towards down the home stretch.First and foremost, much credit has to be given to Lawrence for an incredible acting performance...one that I could see perhaps taking home some hardware. One film at a time, she is proving that she is oh so much more than a pretty face (even though she is very much that, too!) and rising above her teen-themed Hunger Games routes. Just the fact that she can go from playing Katniss Everdeen to Joy is a testament to her acting range. Joy's story is a compelling one, and Lawrence hits all the right emotions.The problem with this film, however, is that it often gets distracted from what seems to be the main purpose (telling Joy's story). There are little interludes feating soap operas that are quite bizarre, and the madcap tomfoolery that De Niro so expertly brought to ""Silver Linings Playbook"" feels a bit tired. The story of Joy is worthy of the big screen treatment, for sure, but the movie just doesn't quite settle upon that until about half way through. Until then, it is filled with weirdness and madness in equal measure.So, despite the fact that the concept is sound and it gets some great acting performances, I felt that director Russell went a little too crazy in trying to be creative instead of just sticking to the story. As I mentioned in the opener, ""Joy"" seems to continue a pattern from him in which each movie has to be a little more quirky than the next, which (at least to me) isn't what makes his movies successful to begin with. I liked Russell because he can show a great human story. This one just crossed the line into ""weird"" for the first time."
