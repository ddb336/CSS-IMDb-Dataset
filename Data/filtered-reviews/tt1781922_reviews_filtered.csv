" Pretty Good
",2021-04-05 00:00:00,8,"The daughters pissed me off. Ok granted they're kids and they're scared but, jesus christ they almost got everybody killed more than once. The eldest daughter needs a slap in the face. But I'm intolerant of children so that's just my opinion.Otherwise I liked the film. Owen Wilson is a decent actor and played his part well."
" A violent and suspense full that is worth watching....
",2021-04-04 00:00:00,7,"Initial Thoughts:
I really enjoyed this movie because from start to finish it had me on the edge of my seat. Lots of action. Great suspense. While I could assume what would happen next. I still waited in anticipation for it to actually happen. While some things surprised me. I still thought this movie was great.First things first. Lots of unfiltered action and violence with clubs, machetes, and guns. Unfiltered meaning you saw people get shot or bludgeoned and it wasn't about to happen and then cut away and implied. To go along with the violence you may have seen the MPAA includes sexual assault in it's reasoning to the 'R' rating. There is only one scene where it gets as far as tearing clothes, but nothing beyond that is assumed, committed, or exposed, but it is unpleasant to watch in the moment. If this is a breaking point into whether you watch this film, or not, that's what that means.Second, ""wow""... Owen Wilson does a surprisingly good job in this film as he's usually known for romance and comedy movies. Besides ""Behind Enemy Lines"" (which is a good movie in which he does a cheesy job) I can't really think of an action movie that Wilson has played in. Obviously, he's older and more mature now, but he acted very well as a father and husband, with no discernable fighting skills, trying to save his family from becoming bludgeoned to death by the hordes. His character stays calm, cool, and collect for most of the film until he's exhausted and starts to lose focus. This shows us that he is in fact human and done with what is going on.Third, while the movie was overall good by it's action and suspense. The story lacked considerably. The antagonist of the story is never given any true beginning. He just walks around with his scarred face trying to kill Westerners. We are given a 'why' because of a Pierce Brosnan character explanation late in the film, but it would've been nice to get some dialogue on this characters backstory. Other areas where it seems to be harmed is the lack of attack. In some parts while the enemy are shooting from distance, there are no fighters closing in on positions, thus allowing our family to escape. Lastly, within the family, the only character with any true common sense, or will to fight is Owen Wilson's character. The wife, played by Lake Bell, is never given the opportunity to thrive, and be strong female lead, like I felt she could've been. I know it's scary being in the environment they find themselves in, but you'd think eventually the children (being as old as they are) would understand the concept of being quiet when necessary and having to do some things to survive. Alas, it's one problem after another with them.Overall:
I thought this was a really good action movie with its unfiltered violence, and good build-up of suspense. Story and characters lacked a bit in how they were developed or played out, but there is enough there to enjoy this film. I would definitely watch it again and if you have Prime Video, go for it.""Should I watch this movie?"" My answer is 'Yes'.Enjoy the show!"
" Would've rated higher if not for the kids
",2021-04-02 00:00:00,7,I'm sorry but the children actors destroyed what could've been an easy 8. This movie had a lot of convincing action! The children were way over the top. People are getting slashed to death and your running back for a damn bear?!
" Intense From Beginning To End
",2021-04-02 00:00:00,10,Can't believe I hadn't discovered this movie sooner. A story of a family trying to find a new beginning in Asia but instantly encounter the instability versus what they have been used to and the minute to minute struggle to return to that stability.A loving family thrown into a volatile situation and a raw experience of how they handle it second my second.The movie wasted little time and quickly moves you through what its like be in a foreign land without the stability we are so used so. Basically dropping a family in the deep end and navigating how to survive. You are on the edge once it begins.Again a movie from 2015 off the radar but well worth the watch.
" Brilliant realistic thriller
",2021-03-31 00:00:00,10,Just brilliant. No silly characters. No OTT action. No unbelievable stuff. It feels almost like a documentary. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED IT.
" this is what real thrill is said to be
",2021-03-29 00:00:00,9,This movie didnt let me get boored even for a sec. Great action and thriller scenes and then the enterance of james bond makes it more perfect.
" Owen Wilson keeps impressing me
",2021-03-26 00:00:00,8,"Lately, I have a new-found appreciation of Owen Wilson as an actor. He used to strike me as a silly, half-talented actor (similar to how I used to see Ben Stiller), but thanks to movies like this or ""The Big Year"", Wilson shows that he is a good actor. He can make you laugh, but he can also make you care.I saw ""No Escape"" some years ago with my father and we were both impressed. We hadn't heard of the movie (I don't remember it being in cinemas in Germany) and we both enjoyed it.It's a tense thriller that avoids most of the clich√©s these kind of movies often have.Many times, in movies like this, they overplay the whole ""Americans are the best people"" and ""everyone can die, but hey, Americans are special"" card. True, the movie sometimes does come close to fall into that category, but for an American film, it seems to at least try to point out the ignorance many expats often show when they move overseas (especially Asia). Believe me, as someone who lived several years in Asia myself, I know the type.One thing I didn't quite get is why the rioters kept killing so many of their own. One could argue that the hotel staff might be seen as an extension of Western influence, but why would they kill the Gamelan players or butcher office staff?I recommend this film as a very good piece of escapism with a somewhat realistic storyline that doesn't require constant suspension of disbelief. The acting is good too and the characters are likeable enough. I give it an 8/10 (good movie, worth some rewatches)."
" Owen wilson
",2021-03-24 00:00:00,9,Add this is a pretty good movie about a family that moves Southeast Asia to help set up a potable water system only to find themselves in the middle of a political coup. recommend this film
" Watchable, but don't bring your brain
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,5,"From the early realization that Owen Wilson's character brought his entire family to the most obvious tinder box over a job to the fact that they spend the entire film making absolutely sure they are as ill equipped as possible for the dynamic situation they found themselves in, this is one thriller that demands you extract your brain and set it aside while you watch.I'm a little confused at all the rave reviews praising how realistic and thought-provoking this is-I guess maybe this film is more realistic than I thought. After all, who has time to do 15 minutes of research on the place you're moving your entire family? Why would you bother learning anything at all about even the most basic aspects of the country you are taking your children to? Don't we all just waltz off the plane rice cooker in hand and take $42,000 worth of luggage to the nearest line of screaming cab drivers without even searching for the car service we were expecting?Perhaps the most tiring part of this film is the near constant need of separating from each and abandoning weapons this family seems to have-keep the guns and stay together! You're fighting your way out."
" What if you're a Westerner and get stuck in a political uprising in Southeast Asia?
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,8,"An American family moves to a country in Southeast Asia that borders Vietnam but suddenly find themselves in the midst of a coup. Owen Wilson plays the father and Lake Bell the mother. Pierce Brosnan is on hand as a Brit that helps them out.""No Escape"" (2015) is an edge-of-your-seat thriller that tackles a real-life possibility. What happens if you're unexpectedly thrust into a situation where you HAVE to protect your family? Would you kill to survive? This is like ""The Killing Fields"" (1985) in the modern day, albeit way more compelling and succinct.It's nice to see Owen in something serious; he plays the every-man role well. Meanwhile Lake ain't no slouch and Brosnan kicks axx in a peripheral part.The film runs 1 hour, 43 minutes, and was shot in Thailand.GRADE: A-/B+"
" I wanted to like it
",2021-03-09 00:00:00,5,"I can't tell who is worse. The violent insurrectionists or the wife and children. Not even the terrorists contradicted, fought, and undermined Owen Wilson's character as much as his family. Even seconds away from death they couldn't follow basic instructions that would clearly save their lives. It made the dredging through the movie a struggle. Bright side; Owen Wilson plays his character well. I didn't laugh once and there was zero romantic chemistry."
" Wow!
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,9,This movie stressed me out! Owen Wilson blew me away with his performance.
" Thrilling Action Sequences but the Premise is Fantasy
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,5,"This premise of this film bears no resemblance to current or past reality. There is no Southeast Asian country where the British and Americans are ""controlling the water works"" or ""enslaving the people"" through debt. Its a far fetched notion that only serve to unduly misinform the ignorant.Brosnan's little speech about the revolutionary thugs are only trying to feed their families is a cop out. Any mob that rapes and murders innocent people is nothing but pure evil and can never be justified for any reason. When these people get into power, genocide will ensue, The Kymer Rouge in Cambodia is a perfect example."
" Great idea, but turned it off.
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,2,"Great story - Check
Great cast - Check
Great - cinematography - Check
Great location - CheckBut I couldn't take another: ""Then, kid does something stupid"" as a plot moving tool. While the premise of the story was great, that is such a lazy method of writing."
" Not a bad watch
",2021-03-05 00:00:00,7,"This movie is a definite watch movie. Is it perfect, no, not at all. There are some scenes that are drug out slightly longer than necessary and that negatively affects the flow. The plot is a good one -the script is good and the acting is pretty good as well."
" Edge of your seat
",2021-03-05 00:00:00,8,Anyone who has lived in south east Asia knows how quickly things can deteriorate at certain times and this movie plays to those fears. The families journey to escape is nerve wracking until the end. The Pierce Brosnan character is a composite of many of the types you meet in developing environments . Certain elements of the film are over the top however it's a movie after all and one well worth watching. Owen Wilson is a great dramatic actor and he and Lake Bell are a very believable couple . Highly recommended .
" I was literally holding my breath at points
",2021-03-04 00:00:00,8,"An engineer (Owen Wilson is Jack Dwyer) moves his family to an Asian country (most likely Cambodia) that erupts into violence during a government coup. All Americans, including his children, are targeted for execution. There is virtually no respite after the first few minutes. People are being killed at every turn, including locals. The breath holding part came when Dwyer had to throw his two small girls between buildings to his waiting wife, and none wanted to go, including his wife (Lake Bell is Annie Dwyer) who had to jump first. Along the way a British secret agent (Pierce Brosnan) comes to their aid in a particularly tight moment.
The acting is good, especially the two small girls ages 8 and 11 (Claire Geare and Sterling Jerins) whose performances really get you invested in their fictional survival. It is intense because of this, but definitely worth watching."
" Intense !
",2021-03-02 00:00:00,10,"This is a great movie. Very intense. Good action, keeps you engaged and the acting is awesome"
" Suspense mastery
",2021-03-02 00:00:00,10,"I normally hate these ""other cultures are scary"" films, but this was incredibly intense. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. The performances and scenario felt convincing. When the family had to jump from one roof to the next I had to remind myself to breathe. I've never watched a movie with higher suspense. There were a few moments to collect one's thoughts in between the action, but not many."
" Trainwreck
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,1,OMG!!!! Poor Owen Wilson was trying to do something with his career and accidentally signed up for a movie that should never have been made. The underlying premise of this movie (in a coup we have to kill the mid level managers that work for the foreign water company) makes so little sense that it makes Return of the Killer Tomatoes look good. This is so bad it must have been designed by a committee.
" Concept is good, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired.
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,6,"Right off the top they really should have chosen a different country. It's not believable that Thailand would have fallen apart like this. They certainly wouldn't have attacked foreigners. Generally speaking the acting and the flow of the action was a bit under done. This movie had a lot of potential, but didn't live up to it's best. Still, a good concept."
" Massively Underrated Movie.
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,8,"Not much else to say. Not sure why the Meta Critic Rating is so low, ignore that. This film is great."
" Woke is Substandard English for ""Enlightened""
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,9,"An esteemed social commentator has said that while it's important to have views, it's also important to know what you're talking about. This movie nearly got totally swept away by the Woke Train, and the SE Asia Tourist Board. This is a good film very well made and gripping."
" Absolute thriller.
",2020-12-03 00:00:00,10,This is an underrated film. You will hold your breaths while watching this absolute thriller peice.
" This movie is way underrated!
",2020-11-29 00:00:00,9,"My husband and I are big into movies of all genres and appreciate quality. We loved this movie. It was very intense/stressful with suspense from beginning to end. It speaks to what parents/family would do for each other. We had never seen Owen Wilson in a role like this, but thought he and Lake Bell did a phenomenal job! Believable performances by all. Even the kids did great. This movie is very underrated!"
" Dad of two daughters
",2020-11-27 00:00:00,8,This movie hits hard being a dad of two daughters... good flick
" Better than I expected
",2020-11-19 00:00:00,7,"A really unexpected good surprise.
A tiny bit slow for about the first 15 mins , but it really takes off and keeps you engaged with non stop action.. right to the end .
All actors are great."
" Owen Wilson shines..
",2020-10-17 00:00:00,7,"Loosely inspired by the civic unrest happened in Cambodia, Thailand and Laos. It is a story about run-of-the-mill American family who moved to this fictional country and landed on a burning ground amidst the social unrest...Propulsive direction and solid performance from Owen Wilson.."
" A must-watch movie if you understand its background!!!
",2020-10-10 00:00:00,10,"Based on an real historical event in Cambodia from 75s to 85s I guess. A coup happened in Cambodia, led by Khmers. The Khmers killed so many innocent residents and foreigners in Cambodia and in Vietnam too - as who is living near Cambodia border. The Khmers wanted to attack and to invade Vietnam but Vietnamese didn't want another war because they just ended their war with the US a few years ago. After all, both Vietnamese and Cambodia government decided to let Vietnamese army go to Cambodia land to help Cambodia rebuild their government and political systems. That's why you'll see in this movie, Vietnamese water is just couple miles away from Cambodia land. For anyone who didn't know, after Cambodia government was available to protect themselves and their country, Vietnamese government withdrew its troops."
" Tension, checked.
",2020-09-22 00:00:00,7,"Just a short one.The plot is quite interesting, and the suspense can easily be felt. I can felt the tense the whole time I was watching.Although it's getting kinda silly to see the same pursuer over and over again, as the movie goes. Sure, I understand the point of it, so in the end when they finally face them off again the viewer get this whole relieved state.But yeah, I'm not gonna breakdown the whole thing atm. So I'm just gonna say its quite a nice suspense movie. Its my personal timing fault though, but some uneasiness left lingering in my mind. It is about how man can be so cruel at times; and in numbers, doubling the chaos."
" Not a cure for anxiety
",2020-09-16 00:00:00,8,"As a parent of a young family in this world we live in, ""No Escape"" is terrifying to the very core.I would say that the end seems disjointed, but that's because there's nearly 90 minutes of nonstop intensity, followed by a phoned in closing scene. While the ending may have fallen short, it doesn't take away from the entertainment value of whole movie. But that being said, it doesn't really add any value to it either.Either way, I consider this a highly underrated movie and certainly worth watching it if you can stomach the intense violence."
" An interesting Asian Exploitation film...
",2020-08-25 00:00:00,6,"Very surprised to find Owen Wilson in the lead here. But that's not to say anything bad about him, on the contrary, I'm full of praise for him and this film. Because what I liked about ""No Escape"" was the apparent (some may call it ignorant) exploitative nature of it's filmmaking, with action that harks back to a Chuck Norris ""Missing in Action"" flick from the 1980s, and a theme, storyline that serves the staple for your grungy exploitation film. I am surprised there wasn't much backlash on a mainstream Hollywood film treating a South-East Asian populace as nothing more than a horde of blood-thirsty savages out to kill the white man. That, essentially, is what ""No Escape"" is. I enjoyed how the country, which was unnamed in order to avoid offence, is still depicted as bordering Vietnam! It's exploitation cinema at its best. Ignorant, you might say. But you could also, in it's defence, say it is a film about a man protecting his wife and children. But let's be honest ... It's just pure simple, unapologetic brainless enjoyment."
" Brilliant
",2020-08-21 00:00:00,8,"Really good movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
Maps the struggles of the family and the fear any of us would have on that situation.
Also makes you think as a European about the people seeking asylum in our countries and all they've been through when they get here."
" Some stereotypes, some lengths, but overall really good
",2020-08-17 00:00:00,8,"Best thing about this movie is its cast with Wilson and Brosnan feeling 100% authentic and everyone doing a really good jobCinematography is above average, so is the script and everything else-1 for a few scenes that are just too long. They are needed to give the audience a break, but they're just a bit too long.-1 for too much 90s Hollywood at some points.CAUTION: This is not an action flick. This is something in between a nightmare horror movie and an intense war movie. It is well done, but not for the light hearted.I would love to see more of this kind. It's so rare to be really emotionally involved in a movie, one can clearly say this one is a gem."
" Absolutely Terrifying
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,8,The intensity of this movie makes most horror movies-especially slasher films-look boring in comparison.Sure it is over the top but it is not meant as a documentary-it is designed to scare and scare it does big time. Owen Wilson is great as the lead and should do more of this stuff.
" No interest in visiting Unnamed Asian country
",2020-08-05 00:00:00,5,"No Escape was directed by John Erick Dowdle, written by John Erick Dowdle and Drew Dowdle, and stars Owen Wilson, Lake Bell, Sterling Jerins, Claire Geare, and Pierce Brosnan. It is about a family that has recently moved to a south Asian country, and as they settle in, a coup takes place within the country; and those responsible are killing all foreigners on sight. The family has to escape while they have time.Plotting is built wholly on running, which is a commendable effort, but needed more substance or set pieces to serve its story. Jack Dwyer's (Wilson) personal company recently went bankrupt, and now working under another company, he takes his wife Annie (Bell), and daughters Lucy and Beeze (Jerins and Geare) to live in an unnamed Asian country as he works. On the plane they meet Hammond (Brosnan), and experienced traveler with a military background who acts as a bodyguard to the family. While they were settling into a hotel, the Prime Minister is assassinated, and on the following morning the family and Hammond see clashes between rioters and police. The group must find either a safe place to hide, or cross a border.Characters are weak, but since the movie barely lets up this does not matter too much. Jack has a past that, in a way, catches up with him. He is shown to be an independent guy by working for himself, but has to submit when things do not work out for him. Annie is just ""the wife character"", while she is a strong person; being able to bear the situation at hand, her only notable trait is her regretting the decision to move out of the US. Lucy and Beeze have no real personality, and nothing to differentiate the two aside from their ages. Hammond is really out of place; not necessarily in his character, but in his dialogue. His character only serves to make jokes and be a deus ex machina, coming into play in only a few situations, in all of which he saves someone from the Dwyer family. Performances are limited in range; Wilson is strangely believable in his role as a strong family man in will and in strength, although the movie does push the limit. Bell does well with showing the stress and works good as a pairing with Wilson. Jerins, Geare, and Brosnan are all fine.Thrills come in doses, with some scenes of panic and action working well, and others falling flat. The initial encounter between Jack and both sides of the conflict is fine, but is not very well edited; as are many scenes. Thankfully there is next to no shaky cam, instead the movie places its bets on slow motion, most of which just comes off as gratuitous. Wilson and Bell's reactions to the scenes that are captured with slow motion are already enough on their own and the added effect only feels like the film makers hammering home a point that has already been made. Cool moments are present, such as the sequence where Jack has to retrieve Lucy while the rioters are taking over the hotel the family was staying in, and another involving Jack and a boat. Other times the thrills feel forced, with the Dowdle's script abandoning logic in a few key scenes for the sake of manufactured tension.Technically the movie is sound. While the script does suffer from some unnecessary characters and slo-mo, and has some difficulty managing tone when Hammond is on the screen; the set design and camerawork are very well done, making sure to keep the movie grounded in a degree of reality, and keep it all in focus, unlike other action movies of recent years. Marco Beltrami's score is not the most memorable or creative, but does enhance the experience with its presence. Suddenness of events does help the more manipulative moments feel real, as though a family was thrust into a spot they had no idea they would be in.No Escape is a mixed bag of tricks, with some manipulative moments, underdeveloped motivations for the rioters and their assassination of the Prime Minister of generic Asian country, there are good moments to be found; most notably the believable performances from Wilson and Bell; and some thrilling scenes.56/100"
" Good Fast-Paced Thriller
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,7,"Owen Wilson does a decent job here protecting his family as a coup puts his family in extreme danger in a South East Asian country.
Brosnan is under-used but also plays a decent role.
Its tense and its relentless.
Definitely worth watching if you're looking for a fast-paced action thriller without a complex storyline."
" A surprisingly good action-thriller
",2020-06-26 00:00:00,7,"I think critics had to bash this movie for the sake of being politically correct. Stupidly so.
I do find that they could have done a bit better in fleshing out the political plot at the background but the message is fine. The plot is based on a grounded fear. The movie doesnt set out to get deep in to it but doesnt claim to do that either. The movie uses it as a device.It wants to be a very suspenseful ride with a feel of realism and it totally succeeds. A few issues keeps it from being fantastic, but it is still surprisingly good.
The movie's plot gets driven by a situation more so then by a story. The downside might be a lack of depth, but it does serve the way you get sucked in the action and suspense of survival.
There is something not Hollywood about how things go down which also adds to the suspense. You are not sure if it gets an all happy ending. Another positive note I have about the violence in the movie. It is not celebrating violence or going for shockvalue. Something many a moviemaker would not stir around. (the scene of daughter having to shoot her dad was a bit to much though)I do find that the maincharacters where slightly flat, despite being well acted and believable through out. The characters were, lets say, not people I often hang out with. What made them relatable nevertheless was being a parent of two little kids. I am myself an expat in South East Asia with two little boys!
Owen Wilson did great playing a very regular guy doing extremely well in defending his family without turning in to a super hero. Lake Bell was fine; her character wasnt very sexy but not meant to be. The movie shows a somewhat struggeling marriage before all hell brakes lose.
Special credits to the two young actresses, Sterling Jerins and Clair Geare. Child- actors can put a movie down, these girls certainly did not. Pierce Brosnan did wel as a side-character. (did seem a bit like an alcoholic James Bond that just went rock bottom) One could argue he wasnt in it enough, but it made sense as we really need to be with the family in order to make it work. Another side-character was played by S. Boonthanakit. His character was a bit cheaply played as comic relief in my opinion. On the other hand; its a type I can imagine being your driver in Thaland-ish country.I do have a bit of an issue with the climax. It felt rushed. And the closing-shot felt forced, the ending was happy enough without it.Other than those few issues the movie is a well above average suspenseful thriller with an interesting cinematography. The poor scores it got from many critics do not make sense.
I was going for a 7, but I add 0.5 point for the rooftop scene. It is so memorable."
" Fast paced
",2020-06-18 00:00:00,9,"Tense moments,heart in the mouth when they have to jump to the other building
Good acting,however some parts bit unreal,with Pierce coming out of nowhere,guess its a movie
But nice"
" No Escape
",2020-06-17 00:00:00,4,"I had missed this on television a couple of times, all I knew about it was the title and the two male actors starring, and I didn't really care if it was rated a little low by critics, directed by John Erick Dowdle (Quarantine, Devil, As Above, So Below). Basically, somewhere in Southeast Asia, a Prime Minister (Vuthichard Photphurin) closes a deal with a representative of Cardiff, an American company specialising in water systems. After the representative leaves, a group of armed rebels initiate a coup d'√©tat and assassinate the Prime Minister. Seventeen hours earlier, Jack Dwyer (Owen Wilson), new employee with Cardiff, is flying to the country with his wife Annie (Lake Bell) and their daughters Lucy (Sterling Jerins) and Briegel ""Beeze"" Dwyer (Claire Geare). After landing, they run into a Briton named Hammond (Pierce Brosnan) who offers them a ride with him and his friend ""Kenny Rogers"" (Sahajak Boonthanakit), to the Imperial Lotus Hotel, where many foreigners are staying. At the hotel, the phone lines, television, and internet are down all over the city. Jack stops by the bar and chats with Hammond. The next morning, Jack goes out to buy a newspaper, and inadvertently winds up in the middle of a conflict between armed protesters and the police. The two forces clash violently as Jack makes his escape. Eventually, the protesters gain the upper hand and begin killing the police. Jack runs back to the hotel and witnesses the rebels executing an American Cardiff employee. The rebels follow Jack, break through the barricaded main hotel entrance, and begin indiscriminately slaughtering the staff and guests. Jack makes it back to his family's room but learns that Lucy is swimming in the pool downstairs. Jack barely gets to Lucy in time before rebels try to attack them. A horrified Annie sees the rebels going from room to room, killing the guests. She narrowly manages to keep them out. As Jack returns with Lucy, Hammond saves him from a rebel in the stairwell, and tells him to get to the roof. Jack's family make it to the roof and join several hotel guests and staff who have gathered and blocked the door. On the roof, Jack is warned away from leaning over the edge of the roof, as the rebels below will shoot whoever they can see. Jack looks over anyway and sees that hundreds of rebels gathered outside the hotel, and that they have seized most of the city. A French hotel guest interprets what they are chanting, and they learn that the rebels are protesting the foreign corporations' control of the water supply. A helicopter is heard approaching, everyone is relieved as they believe they are being rescued. But then they run in terror as they realise it is the rebels, who open fire on the people below. As Jack's family runs for cover, the helicopter becomes entangled in electrical wires and crashes. Another band of rebels breaks through the blocked door and shoot most of the survivors, but Jack and his family manage to jump onto the roof of an office building opposite. Jack looks back and sees the rebels executing the remaining hotel guests and staff, and sees a rebel holding a poster of Cardiff with his face on it, realising he is a high-value target. After climbing down the building and breaking a window into an office, a tank targets the office, firing and killing many people inside. Jack's family hides under some debris as the rebels swarm the building and murder the office workers. The family hide until nightfall; they are surprised by a looting rebel, and Jack is forced to kill him, much to his and Annie's horror. They find a map and take clothes from dead office workers to disguise themselves, and on a stolen moped make their way to the American embassy. On the way they evade a crowd of rebel demonstrators, with only one person noticing them as foreigners, but not saying anything. Arriving at the embassy, they find it is overrun and deserted with several American guards dead, before feeling they are spotted by rebels, including the leader from the hotel massacre. The family takes shelter in a Buddhist shrine garden nearby, only for rebels to start searching for them. Jack attempts to steal a gun, while Annie tries to draw the rebels' attention away from Jack, while Lucy and Beeze hide. Jack finds the gun is unloaded and is restrained, and the group's leader is about to rape Annie. Then Hammond and Kenny appear, shooting most of the rebels, except for the leader who escapes. The family are taken to a place of safety, and while they eat, Hammond explains that he and Kenny work for the British government. He also explains the situation between agents and the former government which angered the people and led to the uprising. Hammond explains that their plan is to get to the nearby river, and sail a boat across the border to Vietnam, where they hope to receive asylum. As their children sleep, Annie and Jack tearfully comfort each other, preparing themselves for the fact that they could likely die. Before they can go ahead with the plan, the group is attacked by rebels, Hammond is wounded, and Kenny is killed. Hammond sacrifices himself to disable a rebel truck following them. Near the riverbank, Annie and the kids hide as Jack finds trades some belongings with a fisherman for a boat. The fisherman hears the rebels approaching, and hides Jack beneath an old boat. Not long after, the rebel leader comes back with another group, captures Jack, and prepares to execute him. Lucy leaves her hiding place, distracting the leader, who shoots Jack in the shoulder. The leader then catches Lucy, and tries to force her to shoot her father, or be shot herself. She refuses, but Jack encourages her to shoot him. Before Lucy can choose, Annie and hits the leader in the head, and bludgeons him to death, while Jack grabs a gun and kills the remaining men. The family paddle in a boat downriver toward the Vietnamese border. They are spotted by a group of rebels but keep going. The Vietnamese border patrol warn the family, at gunpoint, not to enter Vietnam, without taking action to stop them, but as soon as the boat crosses the border marker, the rebels are warned against attacking the family as they are now in Vietnamese waters, and any attack will be considered an act of war. The family is retrieved by border guards, they embrace each other, having finally reached the end of their ordeal. Later, in a hospital, Jack and Annie tell the story of how Lucy was born, a story the two daughters asked to hear many times. Also starring Nophand Boonyai as Concierge, and Kanarpat Phintiang as Bellhop. Wilson is perhaps slightly miscast as the everyman put in danger with his family, Bell does alright as his wife, and Brosnan, putting on a cockney accent, is a good to watch. The first half of the film is really engaging, with a massacre, lots of violence and explosions, past the point when they the American embassy it gets a bit tedious, obviously you go along with it and hope the family make it out alive, but overall it is a below-average action thriller. Okay!"
" Way too intense for me, glad it ended.
",2020-06-14 00:00:00,9,"First time i ever felt the need to write a review on imdb. Man i nearly gave up on this film, not because it bad, but because its so good at what it tries to do, because once it kicks off there is no pause, no break, no breather, its just the most relentlessly intense movie ive ever seen. The entire way through this film i was uncomfortable, praying that they survive this. The phrase ""edge of your seat"" gets tossed around alot with reviews but this is quite literally the first film ive ever seen where i was actually on the edge of my seat. I almost gave up and switched it off, I've never had a film make me feel as uncomfortable as this film did. Constant thoughts on what would i do in this situation were running through my mind throughout this film, how would i protect my family in this situation. I just kept thinking id be so screwed, so that was making me even more uncomfortable. I only watched this because i was in a Pierce Brosnan mood and i hadnt seen this film yet, but Owen Wilson is brilliant, first serious role ive ever seen him in. There are some pretty savage scenes where i thought to myself ""really? Isnt that a bit much"" but no, im glad they went the route they did and showed just how savage people can be. Absolutely not for the feint hearted, i hope i never see a movie like this again. This is without a doubt ""the best film i've ever seen that i will never watch again"". The intensity of it is not for me. You have been warned."
" Brilliant from start to finish
",2020-06-13 00:00:00,10,This movie is an underrated gem. It will leave you on the edge of your seat. A fathers fight to save his family.A great intense movie. 10/10
" One of the best movies
",2020-06-13 00:00:00,10,Although is not a happy movie seeing all the sadness but its a movie That you need to see.
" Foget the negative reviews
",2020-06-12 00:00:00,10,"It deserves higher ratings,
Yes the casting is quiet controversial and some parts are a bit Far-fetched. but so What!
At the end of the day it's a great movie with a great storyline,
When you start watching it there really is no escape, edge of your seat action thriller"
" Not worth one minute of your time
",2020-06-12 00:00:00,1,Not one original idea. Brosnan shows up three times.
" Well designed movie
",2020-06-02 00:00:00,9,A well designed movie aimed racism against the Asian people and selling weapons to the American people by stimulating phobias. Wonderful acting of Owen Wilson. Congrats..
" Best thriller
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,10,"Can't move from your seat for a second. From the beginning to end, it was full of thriller."
" Solid message and edge of your seat action
",2020-05-24 00:00:00,7,No Escape was a welcomed surprise. Like other reviews. I was also sceptical watching an action with Owen Wilson In but I was proven wrong. A clear message of how western governments have interest in Asian countries and several edge of your seat moments throughout the film. The acting was superb and the story was captivating from the start. Deserves a much higher score. A must watch!
" Avoid
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,1,One of the worst movies I have seen. Avoid. Period. I think writing any more would be an utter wastage of time for both you and me.
" Good Story.
",2020-05-13 00:00:00,6,"After Watching This, i Was Thinking If Me And My Family Sufferd From This Then WHat Will Happen."
" Don't let Owen Wilson being the lead of a thriller deter you. This was an awesome movie!
",2020-05-13 00:00:00,9,I was pleasantly surprised by this film. When I first saw it pop on imdb I said Owen Wilson thriller? Keep in mind I am fan of him but I just find him to be to comical for this subject matter. But he did an excellent job along with the rest of the class.The movie does start bit slow but once it gets going its smooth sailing from there. For a movie without huge budget it does the best it can to make you feel at edge of your seat. Its truely a non-stop thrill ride.My only reason for docking star has to do with more of marketing team then the movie itself. Its listed as intense action/thriller but the action is very scarce. There was few times in it where I wanted Owen Wilson to just take off and turn into Bruce Willis die hard type but that diddn't happen.Overall this is still great movie and would heavily recommend to anyone.
" Was way too unrealistic for my liking
",2020-05-11 00:00:00,5,I find it hard to believe they'd be able to over run the police as easy as they did. Also I fail to believe the Thai people would be so persistent in killing all the foreigners. Just doesn't really make sense in my opinion.
" It's not too bad
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,6,"Okay, I have to be honest and say that I was very reluctant to watch this because I didn't know how Owen Wilson would be in a serious role, but he did a pretty good job. The reason I gave this a 6 was for a few reasons.First was that I just didn't really care for the characters, that could be me having a stone heart, but there wasn't any depth on the family or anything so I had no connection to them.
I also found the premise quite annoying, I get the plot, but I couldn't get why basically the entire country is essentially hunting down people. So many scenes where they would be searching a random building or something. Just why, they raided all the hotels and killed off everyone, assuming this place isn't all touristy so why are they full on searching the country all the time. It was just something I couldn't get past.Acting I thought was pretty good from all involved, it had me on the edge of my seat at times and overall it's an okay watch. I think a 6/10 is fine, it's something to watch on a plane or a Sunday hangover."
" SURPRISING!
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,9,"I watched No Escape because it looked interesting, and I was curious to see some serious acting from notorious comedians Lake Bell and Wilson. I didn't LOVE Lake Bell before watching this movie, like I love Wilson, but she has stolen my heart after this one! I wasn't expecting much, and when pierce brosnan showed up 5 minutes into the movie, my expectations dropped even more. I was expecting a low-budget laughable attempt at a thrilling action movie. If you don't love Brosnan, don't be discouraged-he does well and is not a lead character at all. If you disliked Bell and/or Wilson prior to watching, you'll like them better after watching. And if you liked them before, you'll love them after!
This movie gives a really honest and genuine portrayal of a REAL family, marriage, having children, and being kind of displaced in a foreign country that you're just moving to with 2 young daughters. All of it is pretty realistic. The parenting is amazing. The acting is amazing! The action is endless, the tension stays high throughout, the time flies. It's a really good watch!!!Short summary but NO spoilers: Wilson, the husband to Bell, is transferred from the US to Asia for work. He, his wife, and his 2 young daughters pack up their life and move to this southeast Asian foreign land. While it is beautiful and exciting, starting over with no friends or family, with language barriers, and the unknown, the viewer can sense the discomfort, confusion, and hesitance this family is feeling. Soon, there is a horribly violent and mass Civil political uprising and all foreign lives, and natives that get in the way, are at risk."
" Great film
",2020-04-09 00:00:00,10,Complete on the edge of your seat biting your nails
" INTENSE !!!!
",2020-04-08 00:00:00,8,"Okay from the minute when special force appears, my heart litterally dropped. something was going on and you can feel it. something massively deadly. action sequences in this movie are realistic. blood and massacre everywhere. not until they got to Viet Nam could i pick up my heart. The other 2 points i didnt give this bcs something was wrongly depicted ... about asians. take some offence being asian"
" Below Average
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,5,Not as much as interesting. I think due to the location and unrealistic seens.
" Proper suspense but story is unrealistic
",2020-03-27 00:00:00,6,"I dont understand how the writers came up with this unrealistic storyline. They just dont make sense. How come the rioters find the all the individuals for cardiff? Do they have a tracker? They just shoot even in an area full of locals, they dont care if they might kill, let's say family members? Nah, just doesnt work for me."
" No escape from thrill.
",2020-03-16 00:00:00,10,It's really nice written movie with superb acting and realistic action sequences. Loved it. Worth to watch this movie. It is really surprising a comedy actor doing this kind of movie. Kudos to the hero.
" Totally Unrealistic
",2020-03-09 00:00:00,2,Seems like the movie makers are dumb childrens. This doesn't happen even in Iraq & Syria.
" I don' t know
",2020-02-17 00:00:00,6,"There is non stop ""escape, or your family gets killed"" action, and a few bloody
and intense scenes, but it is not like a mindblowing experience which takes you to the edge of the seat. ane I don't know what is the reason for it.
maybe its the shaky camera or the lack of a story because there is nothing more like trying to escape from a foreign asian country where all of the sudden everyone can kill you without getting punished for it. at the end I feel empathy for the father - I assume, everyone does but I don't want to spoil anything. Pierce Brosnan did a good job as the helping hero and - thats pretty much it. its not a must watch, but it is ok-ish. 6 of 10 is a good rating in my opinion."
" No Escape
",2020-02-14 00:00:00,8,One of my favorite movies of 2015... A fantastic movie about an American expat family trapped in an unnamed South East Asian country after a civil war had broke out; fighting for survival and a way out of the war torn country. Owen Wilson's should be given credit for acting in roles that are out of his typecast. Wilson's acting really shines in this movie. While Brosnan played a convincing Blackops operative that indirectly fueled the fire to a revolution/coup. I would recommend anyone to watch it at least once... I would greenlight a prequel to the backstory of Hammond (Brosnan's character) if given the opportunity because it would be an amazing movie. Even a spinoff sequel focusing on the other expats trapped in that same country would be watch worthy.
" This is Sally's favourite film!
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,10,"Not seen it yet, but Sally says it's her fave film, so it's gotta be good!"
" it seems realistic!
",2020-02-03 00:00:00,7,"If you know and like Killing Fields, you will like this movie. i have only watched the trailer. it starts harmless and becomes bad and worse. just like the clip about children of syria on a video platform.
it also reminded me about escape human cargo by simon wincer or not without my daughter. one of the comments brought back to my memory a strange situation: i was a guest in the bali 101 hotel and had a talk with a cute girl who worked there, i told her i like danube waves and so on, but as i mentioned ""John perkins- the economic hitman"" she got fed up. did she think i was there for a dirty job? the situation and whole evening was ruined."
" ""Edge of your seat"" has never been so literal
",2020-01-21 00:00:00,10,"I watch a lot of horror films, psycho killer dramas, spy movies, and all sorts of other films that promise to be ""tense"" - none of them holds a candle to this  of a film! I was stressed and unnerved and on the edge of my seat the whole time because once the action started, this movie was quite literally nonstop with how much it put these characters through!And the children acting as children inevitably would (read: poorly) in these situations was so great to see in the movie because that realism on their part helped with the immersion and believability of the movie.I had my doubts when I first heard Owen Wilson was in a non-comedy but this was amazing and I give him all the accolades after seeing this, as well as the rest of the cast.My only regret is that I can't Eternal Sunshine myself into forgetting this movie so I could watch it for the first time again and experience this thrill all over!"
" Decent Escape Thriller
",2020-01-01 00:00:00,8,Good movie to watch if you want a heart pounding thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
" No fingernails left
",2019-12-18 00:00:00,8,"I almost chewed my fingernails off with the tension in this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it, I thought it had a good cast and it moved at a great pace. A good watch."
" Raw, Gritty and Real
",2019-12-08 00:00:00,10,"Well done production crew! In a sea of over the top, nonsensical movies you've made something logical and with feeling. The actions taken by the cast were realistic which is normally a major gripe for me eg. Me : ""Why didn't they just do this???"" So yeah, great to see a movie that was thought out and obviously edited by someone with a brain."
" Intense, exhilarating and emotional
",2019-12-02 00:00:00,9,Incredible film! Great acting and felt very real. Intense from beginning to end. Sound design is incredible. Enjoy film more with headphones!!!
" What a waste of time
",2019-12-01 00:00:00,1,"Big zeroooooooooooo
I can't believe this film even exists how bad it is. Awful"
" INTENSE
",2019-11-04 00:00:00,8,"On the edge of your seat thriller. Owen Wilson was marvelous. It's a great movie about the will to protect your family and survive. As a parent myself, I felt very emotional attached. Would recommend this over and over"
" A great watch
",2019-10-23 00:00:00,9,"A very intense film, one that you put yourself in the position of the characters. Great acting by the two girls. Have seen it a few times now and it still has me on the edge of my seat."
" Action movie based on geopolitical reality
",2019-10-12 00:00:00,8,"At first sight you'd think this is a plain action movie.. that is until you realise that the plot is based on totally real geopolitical reality. John Perkins' non-fiction book ""Confessions of an economic hitman"" feels like it was used to form the basis for the movie script. In Perkins' book, the core and documented claim made is that the US has for decades used a maffia strategy of ripping off smaller countries in Asia, Middle and South America, Middle East, by corrupting local politicians to sign huge infrastructure projects (a water distribution plant, in the movie) that everyone knows the country cannot afford. The international loans ensure the projects get started, but when countries inevitably fail to keep up with repayments, the ""hitmen"" come in to extract their pound of flesh, as Perkins puts it. In the movie, the local population isn't letting it come to that stage, and is rebelling against the corrupt plans to rob the people of their water, to be replaced by a privatised water supply system. The movie is 99% action, but if you keep in mind the political context of this action, it becomes a really strong story. Add to that that the star of the story is constantly protecting his family, while the rebels are doing precisely the same thing (protecting their families from poverty and water misery if the foreign water company succeeds), and you have a valuable, memorable film."

" Owen Wilsons best ever movie
",2019-10-06 00:00:00,10,"I read some negative reviews on this film so went in with some trepidation. To my surprise, the film was superb. The terror of the situation was better than most horror films and the action was relentless. I watch alot of films that leave me cold but this one made me fight to stop myself screaming at the screen for the sake of the characters. Incredible film and deserves every view it gets. Undoubtedly the best action film I've seen for many years and Own Wilsons brightest moment"
" Not awful, not great either
",2019-09-21 00:00:00,4,"Unfortunately, it falls a bit flat. No Escape is a relentless action thriller, and thankfully, it doesn't take too long to get to the action. However, a lot of it is stuff that you've seen endlessly in countless other films. After a while, watching the characters going from one life-threatening situation to another feels slightly numbing.The characters themselves aren't all that engaging. I love Pierce Brosnan and he is certainly a high point of the film, but he has barely any screen time. Overall, it could've been much worse, but ultimately I found the film disappointing."
" Not too bad, but poor casting choices
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,4,"Slightly improbable plot, but not totally off the planet..... a coup like this in some parts of asia is not pure fantasy.
Tense and exciting but biggest flaw is the bloody terrible casting of both lead family parents. Both characters are simply so annoying you wouldn't mind if something happened to them (terrible thing to say but true)! Screaming kids are always a put off. Last time I saw family casting this bad was in World War Z.
Pierce B could act in any role so his part is OK, bit it's still not his best, saves the casting though.
Can't help but feel that with better casting and acting this could have been a much better movie."
" Terrific entertainment
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,9,"This film for me was a real edge of the seat ride . Along with Owen Wilson being serious along with Pierce Brosnan in his grizzled gritty sweaty role
From start to finish the film packed tension and excitement in bundles along with a much more violent edge then imagined .
A great watch mostly overlooked"
" my notes
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,5,Intense at times but pretty forgettable for the most part. I didn't buy Owen Wilson's acting in the serious parts. and there was some dumb stuff (1 viewing)
" Good film
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,7,This film is good not great. Beginning of film seems slow to me but when the 1st good part comes up it keeps you on edge till the end. Would of liked to seen more action in middle part but overall its a good film if you want a one time film to watch. Also is good to see owen wilson play a part more serious
" Intense
",2019-06-20 00:00:00,8,Pierce Brosnan is one bad ass MF in this! Definitely worth the watch!
" Thrilling Movie
",2019-05-08 00:00:00,7,A family relocates to a foreign country where Owen Wilson's character has new job. This is the story of how a family survives a terrible situation in a foreign country. They have to make some incredibly hard choices to escape from the violence around them. I watched this movie and thought what would I do if I was in this family's situation. Would I survive? I didn't care if the movie was politically correct because it is a movie. In the real world everyday there are horrendous things happening a lot worse than this. This was just a story of a family trying to survive. There were good people and bad people along the way. Just how real life is.
" Mediocre Movie With Annoying Acting
",2019-03-31 00:00:00,5,"I actually wanted the family to get caught as they are so annoying stupid they don't deserve to escape. I am not a huge Owen Wilson fan and this movie just adds to why, I have seen cardboard with more personality than Wilson.
His wife is a total pain in the ass who just cries constantly, no wonder the children are moaning all the time."
" Best movie in a long time
",2019-03-21 00:00:00,10,"This movie was the best in a very long time, i have never seen Oven Wilson play so serious role in a film. He is so good in comedies but in this film was the testimony of what he can play, all the actors was so good. And also the directing was very good"
" Some jump scares
",2019-03-11 00:00:00,5,"I was going to say why would anyone go to a far east country that is on the brink of a civil war.I then realised I took my family to Bangkok at a time when there was civil unrest. I think the Thais were unhappy that their Prime Minister was from Newcastle upon Tyne with a fondness for Brown Ale.In No Escape, Jack Dwyer (Owen Wilson) is an engineer who relocates for a new well paid job in south east Asia. The nation state is not mentioned.As they arrive Jack, his wife Annie (Lake Bell) and two young daughters are helped experienced traveller Hammond (Pierce Brosnan) who has a driver called Kenny Rogers who drops them off at their hotel.The next day Jack ends up in the middle of a riot, the rebels attempt to overthrow the government and kill all foreigners.Jack needs to get his family to safety. Luckily he crosses paths again with Hammond who is rather handy in a tight spot.No Escape is a no nonsense and a generic action film. Owen Wilson plays it straight as the family man in peril. Brosnan supplies the gun play and quips. Some of the action scenes are ridiculous. The throwing the kids off a building seems to defy gravity."
" Better than expected
",2019-03-10 00:00:00,7,"Not an Owen Wilson fan. No idea who Lake Bell is. Like Pierce Brosnan .Film gets off to a stonking start, which is good. Didn't want to hang about waiting for the usual set up. We are soon up and running...literally. OK...some silliness along the way. Old Brosnan doesn't have much to do except talk in a funny accent. But apart from a talky bit three quarters in the action is non stop. Which is good, because I didn't have all night.Get the popcorn and beers in. Don't tell yer mates Wilson is in it....and you can have 90 minutes of escapism.You can thank me later.
...."
" Highly recommended
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,10,"""No Escape"" is one of the best thriller movie. The characters are very human, like ordinary citizen who have no superpowers.I would definitely recommend this movie.Deserves 10 stars."
" It's a little uncomfortable to shake the camera
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,6,"It's a little uncomfortable to shake the camera when you start to run away. I thought that after 007, I became a savior, but I still had to take potty. The weak man did well. After going through the bedding that makes people want to sleep, the rhythm behind is still compact. Of course, it is also possible to turn around in the alley without getting lost."
" Amazing movie!!!
",2019-02-12 00:00:00,9,I don't remember seeing the previews for this when it came out in 2015 and I am not sure how I missed it. But damn! One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It's on Netflix right now.
" Shocked by the bad reviews
",2019-01-31 00:00:00,8,"Clearly our world is a world of many opinions. This was a very action paced and suspense movie from
Start to finish. While everyone does survive even though at times it seems they won't.Loved the idea of fight or flight and what a parent would do to keep his family safe.Great movie."
" Worst filming ever
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,2,Hopeless filming and clipping. You are bound to get motionsick. Studio scenes are too obvious and does not blend into the location sceneary. A pitty since I Owen Wilson does a good job acting and the story is exiting and catching.
" Superb...
",2019-01-14 00:00:00,8,This is for the first time i hv seen owen wilson doing this kind of thriller.It was an edge of the seat experience.
" Critics playing the race card
",2018-12-28 00:00:00,8,The whole Metascore system is flawed by critics with political agendas and an incessant need to play the race card at every opportunity. Political unrest is not common in South East Asia??? Give me a break! This is a very good suspenseful movie about a fictitious political uprising in a part of the world known for it. Judge the movie not what you think the motive beyond the storyline might be. Great performance by Owen Wilson.
" A poor quality and non-logical movie
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,1,"This movie is ridiculous with intellectuals. Non-logical facts happen from the beginning to the end. The country cannot be Thailand, Cambodia or Laos so why Vietnam was there?"
" Not bad at all
",2018-12-26 00:00:00,7,"I put off watching this movie for a long time because of various reasons, and I just recently watched it on Netflix. I wasn't expecting much, but to my surprise, I thought the end results were pretty good. This certainly isn't a perfect movie (though very few movies are that way). The script has some flaws, such as the fact that there isn't a terrible amount of character development, though more development might have slowed down the movie significantly, and the central characters are all the same sympathetic. Also, the reason eventually explained for the coup also don't go into much detail. When it comes to the direction of the movie, often the movie suffers from a very claustrophobic feeling, with the camera jammed close to the character instead of stepping back a few feet. A ""wider"" feel would have really shown the scope of the coup, though maybe the filmmakers were hampered by a budget that wasn't incredibly high.Despite those aforementioned flaws, the movie still works well. It does often have an authentic feeling for what a chaotic (and violent) coup may be like. This results in a lot of genuine tension, as well as some pulse-pounding action. There isn't a slow or boring spot anywhere in the movie; you'll be grabbed and interested from start to finish. And the central actors give very good performances, particularly Pierce Brosnan, who is very colorful and energetic (though it's a shame his role is somewhat brief.) These and other points of merit make the movie well worth your time."
" Brilliant
",2018-12-24 00:00:00,10,"As we all know, Owen Wilson is known for being mainly in comedies. This film is no comedy..its full of suspense and it's very real...a very very good movie. A movie that will have you sat on the edge of your seat...Brilliant"
" A Perfect Film
",2018-12-21 00:00:00,10,"In my opinion there are very few perfectly crafted films out there, and this one was an absolute shock to discover. I'd never heard of it, never heard of the writer/director (John Erick Dowdle, who apparently mostly makes horror films), and wasn't really expecting much when I pulled it up on Netflix.And then I was blown away. There is not a single wasted or misplaced scene or moment or shot or line of dialogue in this film. You couldn't cut a second of it without losing something vital. The prologue is (like the entire rest of the film) beautifully shot and absolutely concise. It conveys everything it needs to without saying anything it doesn't. Indeed, without saying much at all.From there we have a few minutes of calm, establishing an ordinary family on a foray into a foreign country for work, subtle hints that something might be wrong but presented so mundanely that the characters' annoyed but not alarmed reactions are perfect, and then in a sudden, stunningly delivered moment, the entire world turns upside down.The film's pacing is perfect. It wastes no time without feeling rushed at the beginning, and once things start to happen it takes off at a break-neck speed, but every time you're about to lose your mind from the intensity of it there's a pause, just long enough to catch your breath before it takes off again. The action/violence is shocking without being graphic. The stakes are constantly being raised and reset, and everything is presented so realistically that there is a constant sense of mortal peril. Every scene contains multiple surprises, and none of them are cliched.As I said before, the film is beautifully shot. I'm amazed this didn't win awards for the cinematography. The soundscape perfectly compliments both the cinematography and the action. There are so many subtle touches that add so much to it. I could go on, but I'll leave it with just one more thing. This is probably the most intense film I've ever seen. You will be on the edge of your seat with a hand clasped over your mouth or your jaw hanging open most of the film. It's not cheap jump scares or crazy special effects, in fact there are essentially none of either. It's just realistic, dramatic, incredibly tense film making."
" Great movie!!!
",2018-12-18 00:00:00,10,"Must watch, great intense drama! I have a kid & makes me wonder how I'd handle the same situation while traveling abroad. Enjoy."
" Eye opener
",2018-10-06 00:00:00,8,"Superb movie depicting harsh reality of society ,director deserves full marks for making an eye opener ."
" Very unexpected
",2018-09-16 00:00:00,9,"I never write movie reviews. I wanted to watch this when it came out, but never did. I never thought Owen Wilson would be good in an action thriller but am amazed. This movie is so good. It had ya on the edge of our seats the entire time. Good acting. Good story. Such an unexpected surprise!! Loved it!"
" Lack of thrills
",2018-09-11 00:00:00,4,"No Escape is a 2015 release thriller drama starring Owen Wilson. The film was an independent release with supposedly a budget of $5 million making $54 million worldwide. No Escape is quite generic and bland and lacking of thrills. Everything we witness is quite predicable. There are some decent moments but in general, we know that Owen Wilson's character and his family are never in any real danger and they will escape what ever comes their path.Pierce Brosnan steals the show with his few scenes, playing a helpful and undercover spy seeking help for Wilson. Had they added a few twists the film could have been elevated much more. No Escape reminded somewhat of World War Z (minus the zombies) in a way where an American family is running for their lives. The current IMDB rating of 6.8 is quite high and surprising that many audiences seem to have enjoyed this film. It is decent at best, nothing more than a time killing R-rated family action thriller."
" Brilliant Thriller - So Realistic
",2018-09-04 00:00:00,10,"Because there are no silly OTT scenes, it feels like a docu-drama. It's realistic, frightening, powerful, well written and very well acted. Highly recommended."
" Quick Review
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,5,"All you need to know about ""No Escape"" is that it is as predictable and generic as it gets. From the plot poins to the exact way some of the characters will die, everything is disaster movie 1-0-1!Two things saved that movie from being a non-watchable Picture and those are: the first scene - especially a Knife-Act shot - and one near the end involving Owen and one of his children!"
" Ordinary People doing Extraordinary Things to Survive
",2018-08-10 00:00:00,10,"Do not read the back of the dvd. Do not watch the trailer. Just watch the movie - that's the best way to experience it. I recommended this one to a friend and he said he gripped his armchair 75% of the movie! It's in my ""keepers""."
" THE MOST EDGE-OF-THE-SEAT FEROCIOUS SUSPENSEFUL SURVIVAL THRILLER EVER & OWEN WILSON IS OUTSTANDING, A MASTERPIECE.
",2018-08-01 00:00:00,10,"No Escape is a fantastic edge of the seat Thriller that is drenched in reality of this could EASILY happen & has at some point & will again!!! OWEN WILSON gives the best performance of his entire career here & my personal favourite movie performance from any Actor EVER in Cinema History that's how OUTSTANDING WILSON is in his role of a good family man pushed to his limits of survival for his family, simply astonishing acting & so true because what would you do in his situation? Mesmerising performance.OWEN WILSON is OUTSTANDING.
LAKE BELL is OUTSTANDING.
PIERCE BROSNAN is OUTSTANDING.
OUTSTANDING acting & Casting, even the little girls are incredible little actors & the whole family unit is so believable.
Now gotta say that this film works so well because of Owen Wilson cast as the ordinary guy turned fighter to survive as we're used to his face on the front of silly-goofy Comedies but i much prefer him as a serious actor & he's really incredible given the opportunity like he did in Behind Enemy Lines (2001) & i prefer the older Wilson roles that he had back before he was known as a ""Comedy"" star like his parts in THE HAUNTING (1999) & ANACONDA (1997) & of Course, BEHIND ENEMY LINES (2001) this is the Wilson i grew up watching & loving & to be honest i got bored of all his silly Romantic Comedies that took up most of his Career!!! No Escape is the Owen Wilson i like back on Career best form with the best role & performance of his Career.WILSON is Fantastic as a panicky on the edge & terrified family man & he's great to watch you totally believe his performance TOTALLY, it's an energetic constantly stressed out & weary performance & WILSON nails it,he is so much better at this serious stuff that just silly comedy all the time!!! Like when WILSON done BEHIND ENEMY LINES way back in 2001 he was FANTASTIC then. No need to go into the story lots have.The atmosphere is very well done in this movie it has a constant sense of terror like something is about to happen any minute & as a family man myself with daughters i REALLY got into this & felt the terror that wilson feels when trying to get his family to safety in a war zone,it's real edge of the seat drama.Brosnan is also great in this as another good guy character caught up in this revolutionary chaos & gives an AWESOME performance. Lake Bell is also excellent as Wilson's wife & mother of his 2 daughters & she gives a great powerful performance.The south east Asia place this all happens in is a scary place,you can feel the dread building from the beginning & then bang a riot of revolution breaks out & slaughter begins & it's done so real & scary & like i keep mentioning OWEN WILSON gives a magnificent performance here & you are with him every single step of the way!!! A perfect cast & brilliantly directed this is truly a terrifying survival Thriller.
Also probably the best unexpected part of this Thriller is the excellent performance from the legendary PIERCE BROSNAN as a British Mercenary who is funny, charming & deadly & BROSNAN gives a brilliant performance & steals the show as he tries to save Wilson & his family & comes accross fearless in the extremely dangerous enemy territory that they trying to survive in. Brosnan is so good in this part & he makes you feel almost safe when he pops up to help & made me Nostalgic for how Great 90's Brosnan was back in his glory days with Classic's like DANTE'S PEAK, MRS. DOUBTFIRE, MARS ATTACKS & HIS JAMES BOND films, an incredible actor & one of the best.OWEN WILSON gives my favourite performance by an actor in any film ever."
" An enjoyable ride hampered by illogical missteps & blatant stereotyping
",2018-07-24 00:00:00,6,"This Owen Wilson/Lake Bell driven action film is an enjoyable yet difficult experience. It's strengths are in it's ability to depict the isolationd felt by expatriates in foreign lands far removed from the comforts and routines of which they are familiar. Place that into the context of a civil uprising in an un-named 3rd world country where they are not only unable to communicate and traverse the unknown landscape but are incapable of knowing whom are friends and foes, and you have a true thrill ride. The problem is that it is also difficult to watch as certain illogical missteps are made which ultimately put the family in far greater jeopardy, defying common sense, and threatening their survival. It also attempts to make a political statement though it is difficult to understand what that statement is, since it is lost in the clutter of the film's plot. What we do know is that an expatriate engineer travels to a non-descript Asian country (which borders Vietnam) along with his family to work on a project and almost immediately a violent uprising breaks out between armed civilians and riot police whom are quickly and easily dispatched. After that no where else in the entire film do we see any authority figures attempting to restore order (it seems that the civilians in the span of an hour have taken over the entire country and killed all the security officers). The civilians then begin to hunt down and publicly execute foreigners for unknown reasons. The US Embassy is completely destroyed. American soldiers are lying dead at it's doorstep but killed them and why? Why does the country's population hate foreigners? Why are the committing public executions? Where are the government officials? Where are the security forces? Why are all the civilians depicted as barbaric violent savages? None of these questions are ever answered; all we know is that a man, his wife, and two daughters are attempting to flee the country before they are killed. The film wants us to focus on their process of fleeing and not to question why they are fleeing and so we have action-packed thriller that is extremely light on context and does not provide much substance story-wise."
" Great movie!
",2018-07-16 00:00:00,9,Much better than what critics tell you. I love it and it kept me on the edge of my seat. Of curse it's fantasy but it takes you into the plot and keeps your attention throughout.
" I LOVE HOW UNPREDICTABLE THIS HOTEL IS
",2018-07-15 00:00:00,8,"Jack Dwyer (Owen Wilson) moves his family to a Southeast Asian nation (filmed in Thailand). He is an engineer for Cardiff, a company constructing the new water works. He meets Hammond (Pierce Brosnon) an ex-pat who drinks and causes civil unrest with his bad karaoke. The family is literally caught in the middle of a revolution, one where all foreigners must die. Jack and his family play hide and run for 90 minutes.You can feel the intensity in the film during the roof scene which is depicted on the film poster, DVD cover and is in all the trailers. The rest of the movie is anti-climatic by comparison. Pierce Brosnon does disappear from the film for awhile, but returns to give us ""the speech"" about third world countries, (IMF) debt, foreign interests, and economic enslavement. You know, the terrorists are really the good guys speech.The hide and seek part went long. In fact after the roof scene, I couldn't wait for the conclusion. Owen Wilson would not have been my first choice for the role. He didn't generate any excitement.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Near rape. Pierce Bronson assaults our ears with karaoke."
" Thrilling, exciting, action-packed.
",2018-07-01 00:00:00,7,"Wow, Owen Wilson is pretty darn good playing a serious role! This was an exciting thrill-ride from beginning to end, and quite nerve-wrecking at times! Fantastic acting (from the young cast, as well) help establish this action adventure as a solid and believable thriller. The film has fantastic photography and visuals, and beautiful music, too."
" Worse than Netflix Original
",2018-07-01 00:00:00,1,"When was the last time an Owen Wilson movie was good? Never. This was no exception.The plot is horrible - no plausibility between scenes, espeically the helicopter scene was idiotic and the girl's lines after gunfire was nonsensical. This movie just following the Hollywood rules and there is no realism at all."
" Edge of your seat thriller non stop action
",2018-06-19 00:00:00,10,Well first when I first seen this advertisement I wanted to watch right away my I'm glad I watched this this is second time I watch this now it's brilliant all the way action whoever put a 2/10 needs there to get there heads checking 10/10 for me spot on movie 10**********
" Tense Thriller
",2018-06-10 00:00:00,9,"A really good story, a tense thriller done well. Fast moving, some action. Generally well acted. Overall an entertaining movie hence a score of 9. Retained for future viewing."
" 45 seconds
",2018-05-29 00:00:00,2,You (well I) can generally tell if a film is worth watching within the first 2 minutes or so by the standard of acting. I lasted under a minute with this one. I fast forwarded a few times just in case but wherever I stopped it just got more ridiculous. PANTS!!
" Astoundingly Brilliant!
",2018-03-19 00:00:00,8,"What makes this movie great is the factor that it keeps you hooked from the very second it starts. No irrelevant details or background. It takes you striaghaway to the story. The story revolves around an American couple and their two daughters who travel to an unnamed Southwest Asian country. The country is facing terrorism by a group of rebels and and nobody's safe especially the foreigners. The movies shows the family's escape from all that chaos while there is ""no escape"". Overall the movie is good and keeps you on the edge of your seat with a few cliches. Worth watching."
" Realistic Terror
",2018-02-23 00:00:00,8,After watching this film you'll never travel to a politically unstable country ever again. Unusually good (as in believable) which is why I've bothered to write a review for it. Like most films it has flaws but in the main it works well.
" Decent
",2018-02-08 00:00:00,7,"I was pleasantly surprised by Owen Wilson's very well-acted role in this movie.I was also pretty happy with the portrayal of most of the violence etc. The team was pretty thorough with their visuals.I will admit though, (SPOILER) I wish it ended a bit differently, as the ending seemed way too clean for me."
" A Good Movie having good plot to keep you Engaging.
",2018-02-03 00:00:00,7,"I usually don't watch these types of movies but this movie has something and at least worth a review. This movie has got all the things like a little bit action, suspense and thrill. It's kind of surviving story so you must know the ending but the main point here is to see how he made himself survive with a family. So recommendation is to worth Watch."
" Unexpectedly enjoyable
",2018-01-30 00:00:00,7,Having not heard of this film before I watched it on Film4. I was pleasantly surprised. I found it gripping as the family are caught up in a violent revolution. Both the mother and father have to resort to extreme measures in order to protect their family. As they desperately try to seek safety they find themselves running from one perilous situation to another in order to avoid an anti western mob. All in all worth a watch. I even liked the ending.
" A typical Survival Movie, once again
",2017-12-29 00:00:00,6,"This is the kind of movie where you have one hero, go through a lot (in this case, with his family) and also, look for the safest way possible to survive, but yet still fall into traps and plot twists. The idea is nothing to be astonished about, very generic. The execution of the movie, however, was fine, the acting and the pacing, the graphics, everything was fine enough. Yet, we want something more than a typical survival movie. 6/10"
" Surprisingly Good - Disturbingly Real
",2017-12-26 00:00:00,9,"Nothing like adding a review 2 years after the fact. This movie is getting some air time on the movie channels and I decided to give it a shot. Owen Wilson in an action flick? Yeah, that's what I thought. I was about to change the channel, then I saw Pierce Brosnan on the plane, so I surmised he would be handling the action scenes. Who better to win against the odds, and do it with a bit of panache than James Bond? Brosnan's role was surprisingly limited, however, and Owen Wilson played his part of ""Joe Everyman"" with conviction and sensitivity. I forgot about Owen Wilson and began rooting for Jack Dwyer. I was utterly impressed.This movie has some parallels to the movie ""The Impossible"" about a family on holiday in Thailand when the 2004 tsunami hits. A family, in a foreign land, has their lives turned upside-down by a real, yet unimaginable catastrophe and must do anything and everything they can to survive. That's where the similarities end.In No Escape, the family - being foreigners - are literally hunted by the native population, who have overthrown their government precisely for collaborating with foreign powers at the expense of their country's future. It is the entirely innocent and unsuspecting foreigners (like the protagonists) of whom the revolution wants to make and example. And not in a nice ""this won't hurt a bit"" way, but maybe, like, by being beaten to death with a club, or dragged behind a car, or driven over by a tank while the victims are bound and kneeling. I should note that although violent, it is not gratuitously so. In fact, the actual violence that occurs under such circumstances, for anyone who is a student of history, is far more gruesome, and the camera cuts away from the worst of it. I appreciated the film relaying enough of the real violence in the world without drenching me in it. I had a definite appreciation for the life I am allowed to live after watching this movie. There is much that we take for granted.In fact, what makes this movie particularly compelling (I've never written a review here before) is the realism. Virtually anyone can imagine a ""developing nation"" such as Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, etc. descending into violence and chaos. In fact, there are several places around the world where this is happening right now, or may be about to happen. So we hear about these things in the news all of the time. And in our minds, it is an abstraction: that place over there, with those people whom I've never seen. But in this movie, they put you right in the middle of it in a way that is completely believable and credible. Who is to say that the next time we take our next exotic vacation that it won't be the exact moment when the country experiences a coup d'etat? And what would you do if you found yourself in that unimaginable circumstance? Although our protagonists are meant to survive to remind us of one family's will, the movie makes clear that they are the exception. As is much more plausible, virtually everyone else will die. And that is a realistic world view. Who was left on the ground when the Majors and Generals knew enough to pull out of Saigon? Of those people who were literally left behind, well, you can fill in the rest of the picture yourself.That is what this movie is about. But what makes it compelling and deeply affecting is actually love. Wow, I sound like a Hallmark cliche! But that is the truth, however much of a cliche. It is the love of this nuclear family unit that adds a compelling depth, an unexpected layer of humanity that elevates this movie above your average action/thriller fare: 1. First of all, anyone with any empathy, any sense of compassion whatsoever can immediately put themselves in the roles of these four scared, desperate, determined people. 
2. Secondly, it occurs completely within the realm of that which is believable - yes, it could happen, it could even happen to me. 
3. Thirdly, what torment must take hold of a parent's mind when they see men, women and children being murdered all around them? What demon enters one's mind when they imagine their lover, their spouse being beaten and killed - or worse...?These are the elements that ratchet-up the drama to seemingly untenable heights, yet the writers and director maintain this fevered pitch from beginning to end. And within that context, we are asked, ""What level of desperation causes a parent to fling their child off of a roof - either to the top of another building - or to their certain death? Could you do it? Would your throw be enough? If you failed, would you have the strength to go on, for the sake of the others?"" These are pretty intense questions that get asked again and again within the confines of extraordinary circumstances, and it never gets any easier. I think of all of the action-packed movies I've seen over the years: the fist ten minutes of Raiders of the Lost Ark are forever etched on my mind. The relentless pace of Training Day practically had me reaching for the aspirin by the time it was over. But this, this movie stands apart. Yes, it is action packed and you will be exhausted by the conclusion, and deservedly so. But part of that exhaustion is the emotional toll. The realism and the dilemma of trying - not to keep yourself alive, as is the usual perspective - to keep people other than yourself alive, and what that asks of you, that is the emotional toll of this movie, and it is well earned. The writers, Drew Dowdle and John Erick Dowdle, did an exceptional job elevating this from an action film to an action drama. They make the emotional anguish palpable; you cry for their torment. You don't necessarily have time to consider this while you're watching the movie, but the impact it leaves is significant. There are a couple of nit-picky flaws, some scenes that are predictable, some things that are simply inexplicable, and some things that are a symptom of Hollywood cheese. The flaws are easy to overlook when considering the whole, and I won't waste time obsessing about them anymore than a viewer should worry about them. This movie only got 4.5 stars out of 10 on Rotten Tomatoes? Last I checked, even G-d didn't create a perfect world. How many 8-10's do they have? Two? As I've said, I've never written a review on here, and the first one I'm writing is for a movie that is two years old. So that should give you an indication of the impression it left.Hope you get a chance to see it.

" One of my FAV movies of ALL time!
",2017-10-08 00:00:00,10,"100% absolutely awesome, and CRAZY! Good crazy, I mean sure it's a scary movie, but it's awesome and so very REAL!!! I love how real the producers made this movie. Things like or similar to this happens all the time, the world is on an edge and it feels like every breath it takes, we tilt a little further forward... this movie is FANTASTIC! It's a must to watch.. don't skip, don't turn around, watch the whole thing! It made me cry my heart out! I loved it! I loved it so much that I'm going to watch it again, the second time in a row in two days. It's way better than I thought it would be and totally threw me off the couch. And yes it has many f words and others, but beyond that, it is very neat and amazing. Though it may not be based on a true story, there are stories out there needing to be told because some things in this movie do happen."
" Action Tense Action
",2017-09-16 00:00:00,8,"This movie was much better than I expected it to be. The movie is full of action, drama, and heart-felt pain in which the characters experiences. After viewing this movie, I am going to be careful where I travel. Many people in other countries hate Americans, the British, and Europeans for that matter, because of the way their land, natural resources, and water has been ravaged. Americans, the British, etc. come over into a country and take over, not allowing the natives any say. The Europeans came over to the, now-called America lands, and brutally attacked the natives and took the land. Historically, man has been pillaging one another's lands for centuries. Will we ever learn to share the natural resources? I guess not, especially when we view the ultra-wealthy upper one percent who has completely taken over the United States. Shame. But good movie."
" Wow, A "" I forgot to breathe while watching"" film
",2017-08-22 00:00:00,10,"In a few scenes and many moments of this film, I forgot to breathe. That is how awesome the movie is. I don't write reviews for film but I need to write one for this movie. Great script, wonderful performance, great directing. Love it !!! My definition of a good movie : ""You need to pee but you need to know what happens next so you hold it in. You forget to breathe.The movie wakes you the heck up instead of putting you to a peaceful sleep "" This film will give you all of that. There are only 3 movies to this date that did all those things to me : Running Scared with Paul Walker, Cellular (2004) with Chris Evans and No Escape 2015."
" This action packed thriller is so electrifying¬†and lively
",2017-08-12 00:00:00,9,"PROS:¬†The acting from the ENTIRE cast was so unbelievably¬†awesome.¬†Lake Bell who is one of my favorite actresses, gave one of her best¬†performances in years. To add on,¬†Owen Wilson played his role perfectly. He delivered every emotion in its rawest form; sadness, fear, anger, security, etc. were delivered¬†by the whole cast, even the little girls who stole the show. Another amazing part of the film was the story line. This concept of rebellion and the families struggle through it was so perfectly delivered¬†with few to no plot holes. I was able to comfortably watch the movie without worrying¬†about pathetic attempts to make the movie more engaging, everything was thought out. This movie is my favorite movie of all time for many reasons, but the biggest reason was the ending. The ending came so¬†abruptly, which was nice because it gave the watcher the same sigh of relief as it did to the characters. The ending was able to make you feel the same exact emotion as it did to those characters. Yet another great part about this film was the development of the characters. You were able to relate to any one character, and you stayed in tune with that character as the film progressed. But you also didn't feel detached from the other characters, which was nice.CONS:¬†The one con that I had was not something I noticed on my own, but someone brought it to my attention. The build up of tension lagged in some spots, but this didn't bother me because it felt natural. But there were a few scenes where the characters were just sitting and not doing anything.www.chorror.com"
" Very interesting
",2017-08-11 00:00:00,6,"There's not a lot of movies like this out there; very interesting and entertaining. My two problems are that of course both kids are girls because that's what makes it all the more suspenseful. You fear more for girls than for boys. Also, the mom wouldn't take so long to get to the dad's and daughter's rescue at the end when they're on the beach. The absurd amount of time is unrealistic and merely to build up suspense as much as possible. Of course she doesn't come save the day until literally the last possible second and realistically, those two would be done for by then."
" At the edge of my seat
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,10,"I enjoyed this movie so much. The story line kept me interested throughout the entire movie. The high and lows from this movie gives me the honor in giving this movie 5 stars. For myself, I travel to foreign countries and there are so many things that can go wrong when one travels, and the heart gripping behavior of how the family sticks together."
" Excellent Suspense
",2017-07-10 00:00:00,9,"I can't believe all the nonsensical bad reviews from critics, about racism and cultural exploitation - ridiculous labels. One of the best, well done movies I've seen in a while.Excellent story, cast, and scenes. Extremely realistic and intelligent.I was literally on the edge of my seat the entire movie.I loved the whole experience and have zero complaints."
" Neuron genocide
",2017-07-07 00:00:00,2,"How such a movie can get this high of a score.Could not stand more than 15 minutes of it.The introduction to this movie (and certainly what's coming after) can be perfectly pictured with this quote from one of the the main protagonist: ""Welcome to Asia""."
" Intense !
",2017-06-30 00:00:00,10,"Owen Wilson OWNED his role in this movie of rarely rivaled intensity. Pierce Brosnan delivered, in his perfectly cast role as well. All cast members were superb and now I can relax after hanging onto my sofa for dear life for the length of the film. ""No Escape"" gets my highest rating. Thanks to the People of Thailand for permitting and cooperating in the production of this masterpiece !"
" Welcome to the Muddle East
",2017-06-29 00:00:00,5,"Why was this made? It's obvious they intended to make a film about a revolution in a middle eastern country, but they decided to film it in Thailand because--well, who wouldn't?It's tedious and dumb to try to set an ""anti-Yankee"" revolution in an ""anonymous"" country. ""The Year of Living Dangerously"" was made about a moment in history when real events outraced the ability of the news media to manipulate them. That was a great film. This one tries to create a similar feel but it fails to work because we all know, now, that this is not type of situation is likely to occur in Thailand. Libya or Lebanon or Egypt, maybe--but not Thailand. Like it or not, a ""political thriller"" should have at least SOMETHING in common with real life, and not be a complete fabrication.Five stars for Owen Wilson's performance and the unfortunate who had to edit this thing."
" Good action, poor script, one dimensional characters and God help you if you're an extra.
",2017-06-28 00:00:00,5,"Owen Wilson plays Jack Dwyer, a man who moves his wife and daughters to an (unnamed) Asian country for a new job. It just so happens that a violent uprising happening the very next day. He must fight to survive while protecting his family from rebels who slice and gun down anything in their way. If you see innocent civilians, you can bet they'll be killed off, just to show that the rebels mean business. The movie is almost a non-stop chase with hardly any breathing room. There is lots of violence and brutal kills, and a few to many convenient coincidences that allow our hero and his family to keep surviving, like Pierce Brosnan's character showing up out of nowhere to help. The dialogue isn't great and both the good guys and the bad guys are completely one-dimensional-all the bad guys are violent gun-toting psychopaths. The movie has a great air of suspense and ""oh-shit"" moments that keep you on the edge of your seat. There is some great scenery porn of this somewhere-in-southeast-Asia country- unnamed to avoid offending any specific one.All in all it's a decent action-chase film with quite a lot of violence and has enough gas in the tank to keep going at a good pace without getting to exhausting. The real cons are the sub-par script and almost total lack of character development. If you can get past that, just have fun with it."
" Shouldn't have been produced by Americans
",2017-06-19 00:00:00,6,"The movie starts really great and intense! My wife and me felt the realism in this movie until one point... (SPOILER ALERT!) The two children's behavior was stupid all the time. Men shooting around and blood everywhere, but the little girl cries out for her plush figure. Then, later in the movie, they did not seem shocked or paralyzed all the time - for me this is not realistic. The worst thing in the movie was that they wanted the American family to survive and be heroic so bad that it became nearly funny in a bad way. I mean they try to kill Owen Wilson's character all the time, shoot with a tank, etc. and then they finally got him and instead of shooting him they wait until the little daughter comes up. And then of course, the BAD Asians want go get some satisfaction with forcing the little girl to kill her dad. Come on Hollywood, what the f.... is this? Oh wait, they did that so the wife and the little daughter can help them and stop and beat the 4-5 armed bad guys who then wait until the family crosses the boarder to Vietnam...You see, I loved the first 80-90% of the movie so much that I am really angry about how it ended up.This is why I gave only 6 points instead of 9. The forced happy ending ruined the movie.As an example: I love Sons of Anarchy and the creator said once ""i cannot imagine how this story could end in a good way"" or something equivalent. See, sometimes it is better for a show/film when you just make it more realistic no matter if the ending is good or bad for our main characters."
" If you're tired of the super hero movies...
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,10,"Finally a movie that is more analog that digital! I enjoyed this movie thoroughly because it did not have unnecessary explosions, unbelievable feats, a plot so interwoven that it was hard to follow. It was there right in front of you and immediately involved the other set of 'nerves' that you would not normally find in a movie. It was not Super hero or Friday the 13th 'Shock and awe', it was real. I personally want to see more of these movies that does not involve computer graphics."
" Action done well but no story or character development
",2017-05-24 00:00:00,6,"Although the peril was done well, I really didn't buy the scenario and didn't appreciate the lack of character development. Sure, they had a decent opening scene with the coup assassination, but then it dragged quite a bit for a good amount of time. But it seemed like this generic character in the dad was really nothing special and it showed. He flies his family to a far off land for a job but really didn't seem like he spent any time researching the country he was about to live in. So then out of nowhere, a coup breaks out. Not just a coup where the citizen ""army"" of ""natives"" is both highly-organized but very inept at the same time. Nevermind that they are apparently extremely brutal, murderous to a fault and like to rape. I found it very offensive. Even remedial logic would dictate to even the most anamalistic group that slaughtering Americans and whites would be politically bad. Even in Iran in '79 they took hostages. I could maybe accept it in a silly James Bond movie, but not the tone they were striking here.At the same time it really lacked a singular bad guy. There was the guy at the hotel for 20 minutes, they lost him and then another one shows up after that for two scenes. Now this highly-organized group of butchers easily get control of both a helicopter and then a tank at just the right times, but they can't seem to navigate around the wicker furniture that the hotel staff puts in front of the main entrance. Also the implausible appearance of Brosnan's CIA agent at just the right time TWICE was too much to take. Nevermind the feeble excuse for it all that he gave. (I also had qualms on what the two kid actresses must have gone through.)Finally we have an end zone. Vietnam. I don't know about you but I would not be too fond of seeking a haven in Vietnam. Okay, as they neared the Vietnamese border in the boat, I sort of saw them getting a warning, but in perfect English? Then the boat crosses the border and everything SUDDENLY is fine. Then the Vietnames then issue another warning to the baddies following the family on the shore IN PERFECT English. Why didn't the bad guys shoot at the family before they hit the border?"
" Utter rubbish
",2017-05-13 00:00:00,1,"Dire. One line plot, reality suspended throughout. This fictional Asian country apparently has no police or armed services, the US embassy is guarded by one soldier, no lock-down, no safe-room. Gratuitous violence throughout. No suspense, last time I watched this kind of movie Wile E Coyote was the villain. I have experienced three coups, seen the scary stuff, seen people shot and looked down the barrel of an AK. This movie is garbage."
" Best action/drama I have watched this year
",2017-03-10 00:00:00,9,"I have got to say, That Me and My lad watch a lot of films [ About 200 plus a year] and most rate from meh to OK that was watchable, But when We watched No Escape tonight, The pair of us were blown away by the way the story gripped us throughout the entire pace of the film, forget goofy semi funny Owen Wilson and welcome the believable and very competent acting abilities of the now mature Mr Wilson, and if you add into the mix the rest of the more than capable cast, great story and production team, you have a winning combination for an excellent nights entertainment, If you are stuck to fill an hour and three quarters on a night I can not rate this higher, Crack open a can put your feet up and enjoy a seat gripper at it's Hollywood recent Best."
" Good action but a weak plot
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,6,"It's a good action movie but the plot is weak. (Spoiler alert). Jack Dwyer and his family are being chased by rebels who have just killed the country's prime minister and thrown the capital city into chaos. They manage to jump from their hotel to a neighboring building. The rebels see them escape and go into the neighboring building but the Dwyers hide until the rebels leave and then slip out of the building. Here's where the plot gets weak: The rebels manage to stay on the Dwyers' trail but the movie doesn't provide any indication of how the rebels are doing so. Then to make the movie a bit corny, just as they are about to be executed midway through the movie, a friend they met at the airport (Hammond -- Pierce Bronson) shows up and saves them, and reveals that he's with British intelligence."
" Not the Ray Liotta version
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,7,"Growing up in the nineties the film 'No Escape' always brought up images of Ray Liotta's (possibly only!) attempt at headlining a major motion picture. However, there are no gangs of cannibals here in a sci-fi prison island. Although, to be fair, Owen Wilson and his family doesn't have it that much easier! Wilson leaves America with his family and goes to work in a far eastern country. All sounds perfectly okay enough, until a major uprising happens and gangs of armed killers start roaming the street trying to put a bullet in the head of anyone with an American accent. Therefore, what follows is movie about Wilson trying to get the hell out of 'Dodge' before he ends up on the wrong side of an AK47.'No Escape' is hardly 'story-driven' ‚Äì I've pretty much given you all you need to know as far as the plot goes. Some might say that Wilson is an unlikely choice for an 'action hero' but this isn't a film about a lone hero gunning down infinite waves of bad-guys. He's here to play the 'everyman' which he has already proved that he can do with his (fleeting) non comedic roles. 'No Escape' is hardly a 'feel-good' movie and paints a pretty bleak picture of a country in crisis, especially when it leans towards social commentary (mainly courtesy of Pierce Brosnan's character filling in some of the background as to the hows and whys of the situation they've found themselves in). However, it is well shot and equally well-acted. Wilson has two on-screen children and, as we all know, having kids in prominent roles can sometimes be a little tiring to watch if they can't live up to the film they've been cast in.But it all works well. It's no mega classic, but if you're in the mood for something dark and depressing (plus a fun performance from the ever-reliable Brosnan) then give this one a go ‚Äì it's well-acted, tense and dramatic enough to warrant just over an hour and a half of your time."
" Where's Ray Liotta?......
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,6,"When Jack finds an opportunity to move to Asia to head his company's new plant there, he jumps at the opportunity and moves his family there. When they get there, the electronics don't work and rarely any cars are seen in the streets. When he goes to the market the next morning, he finds himself caught in the middle of a violent rebellion headed by armed rebels executing foreigners. Jack must get back to the hotel and with the help of a mysterious Brit, must get his family to the American Embassy in the midst of the chaos......Owen Wilson is really known for his dramatic prowess. You'd be forgiven if you were expecting his laid back stoner-esque persona he accommodates in almost all of his films.But here, as the desperate parent, he's pretty solid trying to keep them out of harms way. The initial take over is overwhelmingly intense, because these are just everyday people, and have no training or forewarning to the events that are about to take over the narrative.The action is taut and there is one set piece involving a rooftop escape that really puts you on the edge of your seat.And then Pierce Brosnan walks in from the set of another film and offers to help Wilson and his family. Brosnan is watchable in everything, even Die Another Day, but here, he's just your stereotypical ex marine type who appears to have an accent like he had his own punk group in the early eighties.But it's a surprisingly well made films, with a great performance from Wilson, who proves that he can do something other than a coasting stoner.It gets a bit preachy toward the end, but the first two acts are quite brilliant."
" It Was O.K. I'm Not Complaining.
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,6,"""No Escape"" wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be but I did enjoy it a little. It was kind of suspenseful and a little action packed. Owen Wilson did put on an excellent performance and the acting from the rest of the cast was convincing. Pierce Brosnan playing the part of Hammond was great too. I think his character gave this film the extra little push it needed. My wife and I found ourselves yelling at the screen a few times because of Sterling Jerins' character Lucy Dwyer, the oldest daughter of Owen Wilson's character. Her hard headedness did put a little more suspense in this film too. If you want something to sit back and just watch, this will do just fine."
