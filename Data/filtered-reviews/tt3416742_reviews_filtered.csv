" Classic NZ humour
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,8,"While I wasn't laughing at every joke in this film, it is a fantastically written mockumentary focuses around the lives of 4 vampires roommates ranging drastically in age trying to live in a modern world that is constantly changing and presenting new challenges that come in the forms of boastful new blood-brothers, wannabe vampires, vengeful exes, attempts to befriend reluctant humans, and tension with a local pack of werewolves trying to restrain their savagery.Only negatives is a few instances of stilted acting here and there and some jokes that just fall short. But I definitely recommend it to everyone that enjoys movies like Napoleon Dynamite, Flight of the Concords, Sasquatch Dumpling Gang, etc."
" One of the best comedies of the decade
",2021-02-18 00:00:00,9,"Taika Waititi is a comedic genius. Credit also goes to Jermaine Clement as he co-stars, co-writes, and co-directs this film with his New Zealand buddy. This is quite simply one of the funniest movies in some time. They find the perfect balance between comedy and horror against a hilarious vampire backdrop. The problem with most modern comedies is that they aren't consistently funny throughout their runtime. Shadows bucks this trend by keeping the sharp jokes firing until the credits roll. You can really see Waititi honing his craft on this brilliant mockumentary."
" Completely flawless
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,10,"There's not much else to say about this. The comedy/writing is incredible. The acting is fantastic. This is perfect. See it if you enjoy irony, satire, absurdity, and comedic action. I also highly recommend the series. This goes down as one of my favorite films."
" Thinking outside the coffin
",2021-02-03 00:00:00,8,"This is an instant cult classic. Fun movie that shows vampire in a new ridiculous light, or shadows.If you like it's silliness, then you will love the tv series.7.5/10

" A good film, even if it wasn't for me
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,6,"O New Zealand is an underappreciated country when it comes to comedic gems. Jermaine Clement and Taika Waititi (who is now one of the hottest directors in Hollywood) are both excellent at what they do, inventing absurd vehicles for their unorthodox comedies. I can appreciate this film for more than the laughs it gave me (my mum was laughing pretty much constantly), and I can see that, even if I personally didn't find it hilarious, that it does have merits. Vampires are an ideal subject for satire (particularly given the oversaturation of the genre at the start of the decade), and every aspect is lampooned at some point in the film. A storyline is not totally present per se, but the mockumentary format does its bit to merit the film. Whilst I know this wasn't the film for me personally, I still can attest to this movie's quality."
" Mockumentary at its Best
",2020-12-23 00:00:00,9,"Mockumentary and vampires in New Zealand (land of wholesome people), what more do you need.The story follows a group of 4 vampires who are living together for ages. A couple of cameramen decided to follow their routine and then we have this funniest 'documentary' ever.Actors and the art department did a fantastic job to make the movie funnier. Highly recommend it."
" One of my favorites
",2020-12-19 00:00:00,10,I have seen this movie probably thirty times. Every time I watch it I find something new. It's so inventive and subtly hilarious. Just genius.
" Perfection
",2020-12-17 00:00:00,10,"There is nothing I can nitpick that is wrong with this brilliant offering from Taika Waititi. Casted brilliantly, amazing directorship, a bouquet of proper good humour... 👌 My favourite movie in a long time! These are comedic visionaries."
" What We Do in the Shadows 2020 review
",2020-12-15 00:00:00,7,"Fun movie, has some good moment. Nothing that will probably have you on the floor laughing. But entertaining"
" FUN
",2020-12-04 00:00:00,9,"This is the type of movie where you know the people making just had a great time and you can feel it as you watch.I mean when a movie gets turned into a tv show you know it's good. Weirdly it reminds me a bit of Trailer Park Boys , it seems off to compare but i do think they share common ground."
" I'm flabbergasted
",2020-11-26 00:00:00,9,"Peak comedy, absolutely loved it! The jokes are so smart and while the plot may be simple, it mixes up vampires and all that to the real world easily, making you cry-laughing in the process."
" Relentless Comedy
",2020-11-20 00:00:00,9,"In my over 12 plus years on IMDB I've never written a review. And I know comedy is subjective to the viewer. But It is very rare to find a movie like this. Perfect is a word I'd use to describe it. In the end, the only problem with this entertainment is that you could watch it forever. We could follow these characters for every moment of their lives and you'd still love it. 10/10 Brilliant"
" Fiendishly funny
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,8,"Done in the style of a documentary Taika Waititi both directs and acts in the film, he's got some great range. The vampires are hilarious and each have their own little quirks, there was a joke basically every 30 seconds and most hit the mark.The obvious premise of vampire roommates is genius and the gap between them and the modern world is brilliantly done, every character had enough screen time to get relatively well invested in and care about.8/10: One of the best mockumentaries I've seen before, and done very cleverly"
" Fantastic in the moment.
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,7,"So i've been a kiwi for a long time now, since I was born. And I somehow hadn't seen what we do in the shadows until a few days ago. I am very familiar with Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement so I knew what to expect, I got exactly what I was expecting and that's not a bad thing.What we do in the shadows is so clever and so funny. I think the fantastic performances hold this movie together. Taika Waititi, Jemaine Clement and Jonny Brugh give some of my favourite comedic performances ever. All of the line delivery is phenomenal, the physical comedy works brilliantly as well.Most of the gags work for me, but unfortunately a couple of fantastic gags were overused a bit. The gag with the police officers not noticing what's directly in front of them was hilarious the first time, but by the third time it didn't really land. The gag about characters pointing out the documentary crew was also very funny the first couple times but was also used a little too often for my taste.The cinematography and editing were used to great comedic effect and made for some historical gags, documentary style really helped with this. What we do in the shadows is one of my favourite mockumentary, but I don't think I'll be watching it all that often. It's fun in the moment but it's not challenging in any way. I really enjoyed my experience but it doesn't give much to think about when the film is over. I still recommend that you watch it. You can watch it by yourself, I did, but it would be a hilarious group experience."
" Amusing, wry satire
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,8,"Great movie! It's clever, wry satire of modern life's foibles and challenges through the experiences of a bunch of slightly goofy vampires. Taika Waititi is an adorably batty genius, a great writer and actor. I love the deadpan tone and bursts of outright silliness in this movie."
" A fun Halloween film
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,7,"I remember when this movie came out and everyone was raving about it. Since then, I had completely forgotten about it unit today, when an email from HBO recommended it as part of their Halloween offering. Those memories of everyone saying how great it was and the fact that it is a Taika Waititi project made me eager to watch it.To be completely honest with you, I'm a little disappointed. That is probably due to my expectations, but nonetheless, I didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to.
First of all, is it funny? At times, sure. I wasn't howling with laughter at every joke but certainly, some of them landed. By far, the best and funniest thing about this entire film is the setting. Having four vampires of varying ages living together as flatmates is rather funny on its own. Unfortunately, I felt that that side was explored very little. Instead, the movie tries to introduce new characters and find comedy in their reactions to this whole ordeal. I would've been completely fine with watching the four main characters living their lives as vampire flatmates for the entire 86 minutes that this film runs for. They were by far the best and funniest characters in the film.As it is Halloween, I probably ended up enjoying this film more than I would've, say in July. And as a Halloween film, it works great. Obviously, there are vampires in it, but there are also werewolves and zombies, be it in very minor roles. The werewolves were in fact one the best parts of this movie.The mockumentary style and mostly funny jokes make this film a worthwhile watch. And of course, as with all comedies, you might end up enjoying this far more than I did, depending on your sense of humour. For me though, this was nothing more than a fun Halloween movie that made laugh a good few times."
" Best film ever made.
",2020-10-29 00:00:00,10,Best film ever made. Features a vampire hoovering.
" One of the more enjoyable films in recent memory.
",2020-10-28 00:00:00,9,"In just about every scene it had, this movie had me laughing. Each character brings, to the table, their unique traits and adds, throughout the film, a bevy of hilarious jokes. The use of horror monster ""rules"" from genre lore fits with the comedy incredibly well, and that is a testament to the film's writing. The use of the mockumentary format beautifully provides a connection between the characters and the viewer. One of my favorite filmmakers is Taika Waititi, and this is one of his best."
" Must keep making more shows
",2020-10-28 00:00:00,10,"Hello, I just watched ""What we do in the shadows"", and I don't remember when I laughed so hard I was in tears. Those guys are awesome actors, the whole storyline/documentary style way they put it together was pure genius, very clever. I didn't want it to end, great writers. The world needs more comedy like this, I hope you'll continue these guys in a weekly series, I know it would be a hit, #1 in the ratings, please let me know. Again, great job guys, Mary from Phoenix. 10/28/2020"
" ""I think we drink virgin blood because it sounds cool.""
",2020-10-11 00:00:00,7,"Meet Viago (Taika Waititi), Vladislav (Jemaine Clement), Deacon (Jonny Brugh), and the Nosferatu-like Petyr (Ben Fransham). They're four hip, happening New Zealanders who just happen to be centuries-old vampires (and flatmates). A documentary crew films their activities, and their problems of living in modern-day NZ are sometimes universal, ex. delegating chores. Others are just plain amusing: they can't go into nightclubs unless they're invited in, of course. Some problems arise when the dorky Nick (Cori Gonzalez-Macuer) is bitten by Petyr, and can't adjust to the vampire lifestyle as well as the others have.Done in the style of a ""mockumentary"", complete with personal testimonials given by the principals, this vampire comedy is like many movies in the comedy genre. It doesn't always work very well, but the gags & jokes that DO land are quite funny. In any event, the movie is put over nicely by its very engaging cast. Deacon and Nick were this viewers' favourite characters. We also see other individuals who are part of the vampires' little world, such as their ""familiar"", family woman Jackie (Jackie van Beek), who must clean up after kills and procure victims. Another very amusing character is the soft-spoken Stu (Stu Rutherford), Nicks' human friend. His extremely under-stated reactions to the madness around him are a hoot.Among the highlights are the altercations that the vampires have with other beasts, especially a pack of werewolves led by Anton (Rhys Darby). For once, we see a movie where men who are werewolves actually take off their clothes before they transform so the clothes don't get torn to shreds! Waititi and Clement also wrote and directed the film, and they get the look and feel of a ""mockumentary"" just right. They also know just how to send their viewers away with a smile.Followed by a TV series.Seven out of 10."
" Hilarious
",2020-10-10 00:00:00,8,"One of the few movies that can actually make me laugh, great blend of horror and comedy. I love all of the character's, hard to pick a favorite but its probably the nosferatu looking guy. There is no reason not to watch this."
" We drink virgin blood because it sounds cool.
",2020-10-05 00:00:00,7,"Released in 2014, this comedy horror film is fly-on-the-wall mockumentary following the exploits of 4 modern day vampires living together as flatmates in the New Zealand town of Wellington. It was released fairly 'under the radar' but went on to receive lots of world-wide praise for how original and funny it is.Brief Summary:
Four vampires living in New Zealand going about their day-to-day life.Detailed Summary:
Viago, Deacon, Vladislav and Petyr are vampiric housemates who live together in New Zealand. They live fairly normal and mundane lives, doing chores, paying rent, and occasionally going out to nightclubs. One night, one of their meals is not killed properly and is turned into a vampire too. Nick, a modern twenty-something year old, is irresponsible of his new vampiric powers and goes as far as inviting his human friend into the arrangement, a bit of a no-no in the world of the undead. As events develop the vampire friends have to deal with their life while working with the new circumstances that have arisen.Film Stuff:
Directed, written, and starring Jermaine Clement and Taika Waititi this 2014 film is more a labour of love and art, rather than a piece of work that was meant to be a blockbuster smash. Made with a budget of around $1.6 million this 86 minute film went on to gross $7 million at the global box office, so it's not necessarily just a bit of a laugh, some serious work went into this to make it a success. The concept of the film was developed using a short film in 2005 (""What we do in the Shadows: Interviews with some Vampires"") as a litmus test. Music in this film comes from Plan 9, with Russian rock band Leningrad providing a song for the trailer and the end credits. The success of the film led to various spin-off TV series; in New Zealand ""Wellington Paranormal"", and TV series with the films title in the USA and UK. With some excellent, low-budget effects, fun make-up and costumes this is film really has a unique look and feel.Cast:
At the top of the billing are Jemaine Clement and Taiki Waititi as Vladislav ""The Poker"" (based on Gary Oldman's performance in ""Bram Stokers Dracula"", and Viago ""The Dandy"" (based on Louis de Pointe du Lac from ""Interview with a Vampire"" - both are hilarious in their respective roles. They really lead the cast well and drive the film forward smartly. The bad boy of the group is Deacon (Jonny Brugh) who plays a great role as the ex-Nazi vampire experiment (based on David from ""The Lost Boys""). Ben Fransham plays the dark horse of the group, Petyr (based on Count Orlok from ""Nosferatu""), a character that is hundred of years old and easily the old man of the group and therefor the least human of the group. Nick and Stu (Cori Gonzalez-Macuer and Stu Rutherford) are the newcomers to the nest and do well (Nick being reminiscent of Edward from ""Twilight""). Rhys Darby pops up leading a pack of Werewolves, he is good light relief to the seriousness of the Vampire chronicles. There are also plenty of other great performances in the film from other Vampires, Werewolves, Zombies and even the living humans too.Wrap-up
I enjoyed this original mockumentary film and had a good laugh throughout. It is not a lengthy film and combined with some good editing this film never feels like it is dragging. There is a fun look and feel to the film which I really enjoyed. The effects were wobbly and shaky and worked well - lots of fake blood plenty of high wire flying. At times, the humour is laugh out loud ridiculous, while other times it is absolutely sterile deadpan; both of which suit the film really well. The film does not take itself too seriously at all and provides some good nostalgia to fans of vampire and supernatural films. Expect to see references to ""Nosferatu"", ""The Lost Boys"", ""Twilight"", ""Dracula"", ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Blade"", ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", and so many more horror and supernatural staples of film. I read a review describing this film as the ""Spinal Tap"" of the vampire documentary films and that is quite an apt description. It is ""The Office"" meets ""Flight of the Conchords"" meets ""Being Human"" and most importantly, it is a damn fine film.Go into this with no expectations and you will be delights. It is probably not a family film despite its 15-rating due to the graphic nature of some of the horror - even though it is hilarious. Fresh, funny, strange but entertaining, this film is sure to be cult film for many years to come."
" totally didn't expect this comedy gold
",2020-09-19 00:00:00,9,I was laughing the entire time - I enjoyed it SO much. Every scene was just so fascinating and I didn't want it to end. Highly recommended it for anyone looking for a laugh
" I'm so confused.....
",2020-09-18 00:00:00,4,"Why does everyone love this? Why do you all find it so hilarious? I don't think I laughed once during this. I like the idea of a vampire mockumentary thing, interesting idea but I feel like the main point was for it to be funny. I just didn't find it that funny. Maybe this was so ridiculously overhyped or it just isn't on my humour wavelength. Honestly so disappointed."
" Hmmm... did we all watch the same movie?
",2020-09-08 00:00:00,1,"The movie falls flat in all aspects... it's ao boring it would be more entertaining watching paint dry... some people mentioned that some don't like it because it lack plot and has bad cinematography, well, luckily I don't need neither to enjoy a good comedy but still wasn't funny.Comedy is subjective after all but the amount of 10 ratings is astonishing! It has dry humor which I do like and still fell flat."
" Bloody hilarious!
",2020-09-07 00:00:00,8,"I'm just getting around to watch this on Prime Video for the first time having LOVED the TV spin off on FX and the BBC.This is where it all began, and to see Taika Waititi before he directed and starred in Thor Ragnarok and JoJo Rabbit is pretty cool.Very funny and very well imagined, but I have to say TV is a better format and if you even remotely liked this, you need to watch the TV show."
" It doesn't work with chips
",2020-08-30 00:00:00,10,"Take a tired genre, some great special effects, great comedy acting, perfectly written gags and the banality of modern day life and this is the result. I missed a lot of the gags as I was still laughing at the previous one. The entire cast play hilariously OTT characters and every aspect of modern day NZ gets ripped gloriously apart, including some of the characters in graphic detail. A camp Dandy. A highly sexed narcissist. Nosferatu. A rocker. A dumb party jock. Jobsworth police officers. A wannabee passive 'roadie', and a bunch of werewolf (not swearwolves!) 'lads'. For me though the standout performance is by Stu. If you are a fan of The Office and the first few series of Modern Family you will love this. Silly. Clever. Hilarious. Wonderful."
" Very peculiar but extremely entertaining
",2020-08-27 00:00:00,8,"The concept of a documentary-style comedy about vampires living in Wellington, New Zealand is an odd one. And yet, it works. This movie is very entertaining, and has many hilarious moments. The three main actors are brilliant and the whole cast has great chemistry. The film explores most of the well-known vampire characteristics, and uses them at its advantage to create funny situations and an appealing story. I would highly recommend this movie for an original and entertaining comedy."
" EXTREMELY dry humor but funny movie.
",2020-08-09 00:00:00,10,"Different from the tv show but just as funny. The humor is dry as a bone but it works. All the characters were funny, Total deadpan comedy."
" Didn't hold my attention.
",2020-08-07 00:00:00,1,"When I started watching this movie, I thought I was gonna be in for some good dark comedy, or at least entertainment. I was wrong. I only got 30 minutes into it and I thought it was almost over, it just drags on and on. We get it. They're vampires so they have ""kooky"" and ""quirky"" antics. You can't just repeat the same type of cheap jokes over and over and call it a story line. And you know, maybe the rest of the movie is incredible. But that doesn't matter because the first 30 minutes are a waste of my time, so I'm not gonna keep watching. I know comedy is subjective and people have different humor styles, but just because something is shot ""documentary style"" doesn't make it funny. Oh because The Office did it, so that filming style is automatically a ""laugh riot"". Please."
" Beyond Brilliant
",2020-08-05 00:00:00,10,I won't say anything further as it's best watched clean and and fresh!
" A cheaply made effective gonzo horror film
",2020-08-04 00:00:00,6,"In Wellington in New Zealand four vampires live and survive together. They feed and live off young victims they invite round to the house, look out for werewolves when they go out behave like fresher frat students. When they befriend one human (Stu Rutherford) they begin to enjoy the pleasures of being a human.Spoofy mockumentary horror comedy that draws cleverly on other horror movies and vampire mythology while retaining its own gonzo style of filmmaking with some often hilarious effects. Inevitably it is a film with cult status and does a great job in a mostly original film, although it can be a little patchy in places."
" Very Enjoyable!
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,9,"I enjoyed this film. It had me laughing out loud many times. I liked how the themes were portrayed. I am not one for blood and gore so that was a bit of a turnoff, but overall, I highly recommend this film!"
" Film Crew on Vampires
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,8,"This what you get when you mix film crew format,vampires and well written comedy."
" Insufferable
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,1,"I survived 20 minutes of this. Comedy is the most subjective of the genres therefore, talking too much about this is pointless.The movie has one objective: making you laugh with all kind of jokes, from physical to silly ones and others more layered ones. But none of them worked for me. And in trying to do that, It was a huge failure. I didn't laugh once and I was annoyed a couple of times for every minute.In the end, Epic Fail."
" Amazing
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,8,"This movie was hilarious. I was not stop laughing, some scenes it was hurting when I was laughing"
" Some fun Kiwi nocturnal shenanigans....
",2020-06-08 00:00:00,6,"I'm always wary of films with posters that say ""Hilarious"" or ""Laugh out Loud"" - they are usually about as optimistic as a water diviner in the Gobi - but this is actually quite a funny, well maybe more quirky, take on the vampire story. Here, our three ""Viago"" (Taika Waititi), ""Vladislav"" (Jermaine Clement) & ""Deacon"" (Jonny Brugh) really are fish out of water as they try to cope with 21st Century life in Wellington - with all the humdrum stuff it throws at them. Clad in their Napoleonic-era uniforms, they have to come to terms with bills, vegetarian society and the fact that folks just aren't that scared of the teeth anymore. There is a chemistry between the three men and the humour is at times quite witty and earthy, though the joke wears a bit thin quite quickly - and when the three lads' search for eternal fulfilment accidentally causes ""Nick"" (Cori Gonzalez-Macuer) to join their number it all just starts to get too much for our weary band of immortals. It's shot in a pseudo-documentary fashion - probably because it had no budget - and that actually helps create a feeling of sympathy for our hapless boys. Though fairly gory, there is no menace whatsoever and in the end it felt like the cinematic equivalent of eating a mint - it worked for a while then dissolved away to leave not a lot. Definitely worth a watch, though - a sign of things to come from Waititi."
" Fabulous Movie...
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,10,This is a great Vampire movie...I can't stand the genre and this movie is brilliant...make sense of that!? It's a comedy documentary seemingly low budget until the special effects kick in unexpectedly. I've watched it loads of times and wish I'd have thought of it. A masterpiece and a showcase of real talent. Thank you for making it. 11/10
" Funny but extremely gory...
",2020-06-04 00:00:00,8,"I have been constant promos for the show adaptation and I finally decided to watch the original movie. I did not regret it one bit. Mockumentaries have always been my kryptonite, but this is totally different. I rarely watch anything horror, but this is mostly just gore. If vampires are in your movie, expect blood everywhere. I watched the movie on TV so I'm not sure if bits are cut. Highly recommend this hilarious but gory rollercoaster."
" Excellent mockumentary comedy
",2020-06-04 00:00:00,8,This film uses the mockumentary format in the best possible way. The comedy here has a very laidback New Zealand style that Taika Waititi also used in Thor: Ragnarok. It takes the typical vampire tropes and collides them with a modern suburban world.
" A nice quirky comedy
",2020-06-02 00:00:00,7,"What a lovely film. It is based on a very simple premise: it is mockumentary on modern time's vampires that are living as roommates in New Zealand.
It is very funny and is the perfect example of character comedy. Each vampire being a trope that the film is laughing and commenting on.
You get what the film is going to be in the first five minutes. The rest of the runtime is a series of vignettes, of different encounters that the vampire group has, but there is no story to speak of. It is simply a straight ""what if"" scenario. Yet it works and it is enjoyable and interesting because the film treats the comedy with a straight face. It is a very deadpan sense of humor. Shall I say humour.The movie's jokes are nearly entirely devoted to the vampires being eternal beings full of magic and otherworldly powers being bogged down by mundane and trivial problem like roommates forgetting to do the dishes and not getting into nightclubs.The quality and charm of the movie then comes from its style. The comedy is served brilliantly by the sets and costumes and camera work. It feels cheap and homemade, that is precisely the point, and it gives the film a freshness and authenticity. There are many clever tricks when there is magic or supernatural elements involved. The movie did not need to have these special effects, but it does and it elevates the movie. The jokes being paper thin, you need
something more to keep you engaged past the movies introductory scenes.It feels part thesis-film part inside joke between friends. It is very reminiscent of the Belgian gem Man Bites Dog but with better production value and with a reverence to vampire movies. I also just loved watching it for the wonderful accents all the actors have.
The film is funny; the film is quirky. It is unabashedly Kiwi."
" I Doubt I Have a Worthy Addition
",2020-05-24 00:00:00,10,"I fell in love with this genius concept through the television adaptation.Taika Waititi is a singular voice. Every time I encounter his song, I cannot but stop and listen."
" Vampire Spinal Tap
",2020-05-18 00:00:00,10,"The premise of this movie, the mockumetary, has been done many times and you'd think that it would finally get boring. Happily, this is definitely not the case. This movie was joy to watch not only for the characters, but the special effects were top notch. This is a movie you cannot only watch one time because there is a lot of subtle things you are going to miss with each viewing. That is what makes a movie great. I am looking forward to seeing it again and also checking out the series."
" One of the greatest modern comedies
",2020-05-11 00:00:00,10,"This film is hilarious throughout, it contains both witty dialogue and superb visual and physical comedy. Of course what people find funny is subjective but personally the mix of self depreciation, trying to be cool and mockumenary format hit harder than any overly positive Hollywood comedy. It feels like the film has so much heart, everyone seems to be having so much fun and that's something I adore about smaller productions like these. This is my favourite film and I highly recommend it to everyone!"
" Ridiculously funny in a nonsense way.
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,8,"The movie is written, directed and acted by Jemaine Clement and Take Waititi. They are both very talented and Taika Waititi is one of my favourite directors, all the movies directed by him have his unique childlike feature which is fun to watch and uplifting. This movie is no different, the plot is kind of nonsense but in a cute way. The movie doesn't have a deep meaning to reflect upon, you could simply lay back and enjoy the movie. Its mockumentary style makes the vampires so relatable as if they were real and were your neighbour next door. This should attribute to the amazing actors, especially Taika Waititi, making vampires so believable. When he is interviewed in the movie, he acts awkwardly just like a normal person, who isn't used to the spotlight. The characters are all goofy and they act stupidly but you won't get annoyed. Some comedies try too hard to make you laugh and end up the character are being ridiculously stupid and unlikeable, but this isn't the case, their character's goofiness is so believable that you find their stupidity quite adorable. So, if you are having a bad day or you wanted to take your mind off of something, this is the right movie for you."
" A Decent Comedy If Just A Little Repetitive
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,7,"Pros:
1. The comedy, when it lands, is of laugh-out-loud quality: ""I think of it like this: if you were going to eat a sandwich, you would just enjoy it more if you knew no one had fucked it.""
2. The set and costume design are fantastic and really help to seal the vampiric gothic feel.
3. The gore and practical effects look really good and are proof that a big budget isn't necessary to pull that kind of thing off.
4. Taika Waititi (Viago), Jemaine Clement (Vladislav), and Jonny Brugh (Deacon) give great comedic performances.
5. Jemaine Clement, Jonny Brugh, and Taika Waititi have tremendous chemistry with each other, and it is unequivocally the engine behind the film.
6. The score not only matches the gothic theme of the movie, but it also helps to breathe a little life into the film to prevent it from becoming stale.Cons:
1. At times, the comedy feels a little forced and inappropriate.
2. The film, especially during the second half, starts to drag and it feels a little repetitive."
" Best mockumentary ever.
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,7,"Usually I dislike mockumentaries, but this one was so unique and funny. The characters were great, the story was interresting. It's a great fun."
" Excellent comedic mockumentary
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,8,"This review contains spoilers.What We Do in the Shadows is a mockumentary comedy movie that premiered in 2014. The movie is directed and written by Jemaine Clement, Taika Waititi. The movie stars Taika Waititi, Jemaine Clement, Jonathan Brugh, and Ben Fransham. The is about a documentary crew that follows four vampires inside of a house. The movie follows the four vampires as they have nightly adventures in Wellington, New Zealand.What We Do in the Shadows is an excellent comedy movie. The movie is similar to other mockumentaries such as The Office which follows the characters around. The vampire characters of Viago, Vladislav, Deacon, and Petyr are incredibly hilarious as they have many misadventures across Wellington. The movie does incredibly well in making the audience care about these characters and the events that occur to them. The movie does not have much a plot much like other mockumentaries and instead has the audience become invested in the characters to tell the story.The characters are easily the best part of this movie. The side characters and main characters are all played well by the actors and actresses and they have great moments. One of the characters, Nick, is inadvertently turned into a vampire and becomes a character the audience can use to follow how the vampires undergo their rituals. This moment is incredibly funny as Nick has to explore vampirism. In addition, the usage of the vampire powers is played to great comedic effect as the movie plays up the ignorance of humans.The primary problem with the movie is that overall it does meander. There is no grand story arc in this movie. The movie feels more like an elevated television show however this is not a detractment if the audience knows what they want. The trailers for this movie were not misleading and never hinted at a large story. The movie is a simple story focusing on the vampiric characters.I would recommend 'What We Do in the Shadows'. This is an excellent movie with great casting and timing on the comedic sequences.Grade: B"
" Suck it Twilight
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,10,"I saw Thor ragnarok and loved it. I saw flight of the conchords and loved it. When I saw this movie I came to the conclusion that taika and jemaine are filmmaking geniuses. Just the first line ' it's 6pm at night time' made me love the movie instently. 10/10. Vampires dont do dishes, Brilliant."
" Dead but delicious.....
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,10,"Funniest movie I've seen for many years.Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement absolutely smash the ball out of the park with this one.To call this merely a vampire mockumentary is massively under playing this work of comedy genius. A real character study with fantastic performances from the entire cast.Set in urban modern day New Zealand, we follow the day to day lives of a group of flat sharing vampires.I will not spoil this movie. If you like comedy of all kinds, but specifically quirky humour, this is for you. I haven't literally laughed out loud so much ever!Go watch it, right now! 🤣"
" Blood-curdling hilarious
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,9,"What We Do in the Shadows was a film made by some of the best comedic talents New Zealand has to offer and they came was a hilarious horror-comedy.What We Do in the Shadows was an episodically structured film as it followed a group of vampires living in Wellington, and looking at the issues they face.The film offers up some great comic twists on vampire lore and references films from Nosferatu to The Lost Boys to Twilight. It comes out swinging with the feral Pytor to the vampires needing to be invited into a nightclub, and a final battle in a park. The film has a great mix of subverting vampire tropes and darkly humorous."
" A different kind of vampire movie
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,8,"This is a great mockumentary, especially if you like Taika Waititi's brand of humor. I'm glad this movie put him on the road that led him to direct the fantastic Thor: Ragnarok. If Spinal Tap meets Flight of the Conchords sounds good to you, go watch this right now!"
" One of the weirdest and absurd films I've seen
",2020-04-09 00:00:00,8,Felt weirded out the entire time but on a whole it works exceptionally well and had me laughing out loud throughout. It's not perfect but it would be hard for a film so weird to be so!
" Obvs the best vampire documentary ever made
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,9,"Very funny, nicely made 'documentary' of the lives of some vampires in Wellington NZ. I'm not at all a fan of gory horror and I get spooked easily, but this film was just very funny, great comedy. The style is sort of low profile just as a documentary could be, it feels kinda low budget but it looks great and they used a good amount of SE."
" The best comedy ever made
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,10,"Never given a 10 before, but this is here is comedy at its finest. Same for the film AND the series, you just dont.want.it.to.end. Watch both, you won't regret it."
" waititi at his finest
",2020-03-15 00:00:00,8,"Based on a true story. actual footage of vampires. informative unbiased and cutting edge. a true source of academic knowledge
shows vampires in their true essence
bromances grief suffering love affairs and blood
cant ask for more"
" Ideal Mockumentary
",2020-03-14 00:00:00,10,"If you enjoy mockumentaries such as The Office and Parks & Rec, this is the perfect mockumentary for you. This is a documentary parody about vampires! Done by a couple of the guys from The Flight Of The Conchords hit comedy show on HBO, this documentary style film is the awkward satire you love. Artfully crafted nuanced uncomfortably awkward situations abound in this parody of vampire movies. It is an intelligent and interesting humor that is very unique and different from anything you have ever encountered. This film is highly entertaining and a lot of fun."
" ""When you are a vampire, you become very sexy.""
",2020-03-09 00:00:00,7,"I've watched and reviewed a little over two dozen vampire flicks here on IMDb, and as a testament to how well received this one is by vampire fans, the only other movies that rate higher are ""Nosferatu"" and ""Let the Right One In"". Speaking of which, the character Petyr (Ben Fransham) in this one is a pretty straight knockoff of Nosferatu from the 1922 silent film. To call it a parody might be somewhat of a misnomer, the picture skewers everything from vampires to zombies, werewolves and anything remotely resembling the undead, and does it in hilarious fashion. The thing is, the picture doesn't feel like it's trying to be a comedy, but the zany situations and clever writing make you laugh even if you don't want to. There's also a fair amount of sleight of hand going on, as with Vladislav's (Jemaine Clement) horrific depiction of his archnemesis, The Beast. And then, when we finally meet The Beast (Elena Stejko), you have to kick yourself for falling for the set up. It's all cleverly done and quite entertaining, so even if you're not a vampire fan, this one might get you to change your mind."
" Enjoyable
",2020-03-01 00:00:00,8,"Definitely one of the more unique and interesting vampire films out there.The writers did a fantastic job with the main characters. Each feels distinct from one another and their respective actors did a fantastic job bringing them to life, adding tons of personality and charm. The side cast also did great. There's many interviews throughout the film adding a lot of welcomed 'intermissions' where further depth is given to the characters.The documetry style of filming also added a lot of charm to the film lending to some nice comedic moments and a general feeling of fun."
" Brilliant comedy
",2020-02-21 00:00:00,10,"Awesome movie, hilarious comedy!
Taika is an amazing storyteller!"
" Loads of fun
",2020-02-18 00:00:00,8,"A quartet of vampires, each from a different century, shares a house as roommates. They spend their time living their lives as any quartet of men would - demanding the dishes get washed, requesting one put down towels before biting a victim on the antique sofa, trying on outfits before going out to party up - but they do so while flying around, hissing and hypnotizing people. It's loads of fun."
" Taika and jermaine combined equals greatness
",2020-02-11 00:00:00,9,Two of the funniest people ever to leave New Zealand makes this one of the best movies of all time.
" And it was Peter!
",2020-02-01 00:00:00,8,"This is a lovely little quirky mockumentary style film. Love the idea of three vampires sharing a flat together and going through an eternity of roommate struggles.I like how each of the four flatmates are essentially from four iconic time periods, and they play off each other very well (mainly three of them, as Peter is more introverted).Also the hidden society that comes into play later on is pretty funny as well.It is quite a funny movie and one that I've seen many times. I highly recommend it!"
" Well worth it!
",2020-01-26 00:00:00,8,After being bugged by my co-worker for months I finally sat down and watched this movie. I was not disappointed. Having grown up watching vampire shows and movies I really enjoyed this mockumentary. The peek inside the lives of these vampires is just the absurdity I needed.
" Very funny
",2020-01-26 00:00:00,7,"A delightfully creative idea for a movie. And the plot is decent as well, not deep but you definitely come to care about the characters."
" I survived the night
",2020-01-18 00:00:00,6,"I love comedies in general and parodies in particular, but I'm not a big fan of vampires movies. But what about the parody of a vampires movie? I chose to watch 'What We Do in the Shadows', mainly because the film is written and directed by Taika Waititi - one of the hottest names on the movie market today, the author of 'Jojo Rabbit' - here alongside Jemaine Clement. The two also play two of the roles within the vampire quartet who spend a portion of eternity in a haunted house in the city of Wellington of our days. In fact better said the Wellington of our nights, because the active life of the vampires begins, as we all know, at nightfall, when they can go out without fear to lure and hunt their victims and meet with others creatures of darkness, for example with werewolves. I am not sorry about the time invested, I survived in one piece and with no bites the experience, and also without becoming a vampire or a fan of vampire movies.The format used by the filmmakers is that of a parody of documentary films, a format sometimes called 'mockumentary'. A film crew (whose protection is provided by contract) is sent to film kind of a 'reality show' that presents 'around the clock' the after-death adventures of the New Zealand's vampire inhabitants. As in any movie or TV show of the genre, there are alternated live footage (most filmed at night, some even in the dark) with biographical notes and off-action comments of the vampire protagonists. The formula, once understood by the spectators, allows for the continuous unfolding of jokes and orgy drunkenness with blood, of the comic and horror sequences, sometimes interleaved, other times combined. A considerable dose of ketchup and other red liquids finds plenty usage throughout the film.The schema works very well. The effect I think depends on the viewers' adherence to the parodied genre and the familiarity with the comic characters transferred into the vampire space. I believe that fans of the genre will find many familiar references, and for them the jokes will more easily reach their targets. Viewers who know the team of actors and directors will find familiar characters in new situations. For the less initiated viewers - myself among them - the result is partial. I smiled pretty much all the time and laughed moderately at many moments, but I didn't roll on the floor with laughs, as at the most successful comedies. Something in the style with which Taika Waititi addresses elements of popular culture is also felt in this film. He does not avoid the kitsch, I can even say that he is looking for it, but under his guidance parody loses any nuances of vulgarity. Unlike in 'Jojo Rabbit', in 'What We Do in the Shadows' fun is more important than the message. And that's OK. A recent news item names the New Zealand director as the author of a future series in the 'Star Wars' cycle. Now I have become curious!"
" Fangtastic
",2020-01-15 00:00:00,8,"Me and a mate were talking abut movies in the pub a few weeks ago and he asked me if I had seen this one, to which I, a total horror film addict, had to to say no, I hadn't. Lo and behold, not long after, it was screened on TV. My mate said that he thought it was really funny and I have to totally agree.
Four vampires, raging from 8000 to a mere 183 years old, house share in Wellington, New Zealand and this comical mockumentary follows their hilarious night time exploits. We also get werewolves and zombies thrown into the melting pot, as well as a human character called Stu. I was very impressed by everything, the wit is spot on, the acting is sufficiently good, some pretty decent effects and gore, etc. So many horror comedies fail in my opinion but this one is a winner."
" Fun, zany and original
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,7,I watched the TV series before the movie which I absolutely loved. The movie is not as good as the tv show but still a great watch. The characters are fun and I just loved the craziness of vampires and werewolves living kind of ordinary lives in modern society. Some laugh out loud moments. A good watch.
" Funniest Movie Ever!
",2019-12-28 00:00:00,10,This is the funniest movie I have ever seen. Highly recommended!!! You will have non-stop laughing from beginning to end.
" One of my favorite comedies!
",2019-12-22 00:00:00,10,"It's very smart, different, hilarious. A very original idea in a world full of vampires who are 'cool', 'handsome', 'dangerous' etc. This movie is so brilliant that it makes you laugh at these goofy vampires but also somehow relate to them. I will never get tired of watching this movie! I recommend this to people who likes different, original comedies."
" I Love This Movie
",2019-11-23 00:00:00,9,"A documentary crew films the lives of four vampires who share the same residence.This is one of the best vampire movies out there. It isn't scary, it is hysterical. There is some blood in it but nothing that is gross or ""out there."" These vampires let us have a look into their lives, day-to-day struggles and lets us see what makes them tick. I've watched it several times and each time I find something else to appreciate about it.If you like horror comedy, this is a must."
" Hilarious!
",2019-11-07 00:00:00,9,"This is such a funny concept, I spent the entire film laughing hysterically. Taika Waititi has such a unique hilarious style and this movie takes deadpan humour to a whole new level. Highly recommend!"
" Best vampire movie ever
",2019-10-19 00:00:00,9,Best comedy of 21st century for sure. Almost all the jokes landed so well and it was hillarious. I love Waititi's humour and can't wait for Jojo Rabbit.
" Funniest movie ever

" Absolutely amazeballs
",2019-09-22 00:00:00,10,"This movie is epic! Witty, cringe, clever and brilliant entertainment.Such a creative and imaginative film, how films should be."
" Heard about this film and decided to watch it. So funny!
",2019-09-12 00:00:00,7,"Taika Waititi is great in the movie and has yet to make a film that I won't watch.
I absolutely love the premise of this film; just a bunch of vampires living in a flat together.
Stu was a great side character and I read that Stu is an actually IT on the set of the movie that didn't realize that his screen time was going to be in the final cut, which makes his character all the better.
I feel bad for Peter though, he didn't have to go out like that.
Also, BAT FIGHT!"
" Love this movie
",2019-08-18 00:00:00,10,"It is perfect. I love all the characters. It's hilarious, entertaining, well done."
" Tasteful, fun and creative
",2019-07-30 00:00:00,9,Chockful of witty situational comedy and some slightly graphical gore scenes. Highly recommended
" Amazing ideas, brilliant and Fangtasticly funny..!
",2019-07-21 00:00:00,10,"The concept and idea of this movie is nothing but genius and comedy gold.This is filmed mockumentary style. It's about a group of vampires from the old world trying to fit in the new world with a camera crew documenting their nightly lives. The jokes are brilliantly executed and the vampire lures are all here with a modern twist.I honestly highly recommend this for giggles..! The cast and jokes are spot on and right on the mark..! This really does bring something new and old to the table and cast, directors and crew do a fangtastic job (sorry about the pun)Seriously check this out it's not one to miss..!"
" What We Do in the Shadows
",2019-07-21 00:00:00,7,"I didn't hear about this film until I saw that there was an American television series spawned from it, I was only going to start watching it after the original film from New Zealand. Basically, a documentary crew, protected by wearing crucifixes, follow the daily (after)life of four vampire flatmates living in Wellington. Viago (Taika Waititi, also writing and directing, directed Thor: Ragnarok) is a 379-year-old dandy from the 18th century; Vladislav (Jemaine Clement, also writing and directing, starred in Men Black 3) is a 862-year-old known as ""Vladislav the Poker""; Deacon (Jonny Brugh) is a 183-year-old former Nazi, and Petyr (Ben Fransham) is an 8,000-year-old, who resembles Count Orlok. The group of vampires live their everyday lives in the flat, still influenced by the cultures from their own times, but occasionally go out at night to town and hang out. Jackie (Jackie van Beek) is a human who cleans up the blood spilt from draining in the flat, she also lures victims for the vampires, her master Deacon has promised vampirehood to Jackie for doing so. One night, Jackie brings a couple Nick (Cori Gonzalez-Macuer) and Josephine (Chelsie Preston Crayford) as victims, but Nick is not fully drained and becomes a vampire himself. Nick brings in new cultural colour to the group. He also brings his friend Stu (Stu Rutherford), an IT guy who introduces the modern information technology to the group. Stu becomes a good friend to them, and because he is Nick's best friend, the group form a pact not to eat him. Besides inviting Stu into the group, Nick is quite irresponsible of his newly gained vampirehood, including showing complete strangers his abilities. One day, a vampire hunter (Brad Harding) comes to the flat and enters the basement, Petyr easily kills him, but he dies of sunlight. The group are also visited by two police officers, but they are hypnotised so as not to see anything out of the ordinary, meaning they cannot see the blood spill and dead bodies. The group blames Nick for this and banishes him from the flat. But then the Unholy Masquerade comes, this happens once a year, where New Zealand's undead community comes and mingles together. Viago and Deacon go there and find that Jackie has been turned by Nick, Stu is also there. Soon the masquerade guests find out that Stu is human, and they get eager to eat him. On the way, the group are confronted by their nemesis, a group of werewolves, this turns into a fight. As a result, Stu is turned into a werewolf himself, but in the end, the vampires and werewolves form a friendship. Also starring Rhys Darby as Anton the werewolf, Elena Stejko as Pauline (The Beast), Jason Hoyte as Julian, Karen O'Leary as Policewoman, and Mike Minogue as Policeman. This is a really clever mockumentary, it uses all the conventions, stereotypical and mythological, we have to expect in vampire movies to its advantage, making for some fantastic and often gory jokes, and the characters are all really likeable, a smart and enjoyable horror comedy. Very good!"
" Intentionally funny
",2019-07-13 00:00:00,10,When I started watching this I couldn't believe how funny it was. Was it intentionally or accidentally funny? It was intentional and I fell in love.
" Absolute must watch
",2019-07-05 00:00:00,8,"I saw previews for the TV version of this and decided to watch this... So glad I did because this had me in stitches!!! I later found out the director also did Thor: Ragnarok, I hope to see much more from him"
" Proper Vampire, Tyrant Vampire, 18 century bambi Vampire, and the very old Vampire

" The best vampire movie in years!
",2019-07-03 00:00:00,9,Really funny both with dark comedy and subtle genre parody. If you liked flight of the conchords then this will be right up your alley.
" my notes
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,8,"Very funny throughout. very different and unique. very clever and entertaining, especially if you are familiar with vampires. also a well made movie with good directing, which is surprising for a documentary style movie (3 viewings)"
" A quirky, funny and fresh take on vampires.
",2019-06-18 00:00:00,8,"Very quirky and funny with an oddball cast of characters and interesting taste in music. It works quite well as a spoof documentary, and the simple yet effective special effects compliment the style. None of the ideas are truly original and it does run low on ideas towards the end, but it's still a fun and fresh take on vampires."
" Super Silly, Super Funny, I Loved It!
",2019-06-15 00:00:00,8,"What We Do In The ShadowsFrom the simple observation, how do vampires live in the modern world and what are they doing when not killing humans and what are vampire issues a whole comedic world has been created.This is a straightforward modern sitcom surprisingly and is a modern version of the Munsters and Adams Family. Brilliantly written brilliantly acted and just great fun from beginning to end.I love this type of silly humour, its not for everyone, perhaps more for a male audience, but I loved it."
" One of the best comedies in recent years
",2019-06-13 00:00:00,9,This movie is so fresh and funny and one of the best comedies in recent years. It followed a mini movie and after this movie there was a TV series. The TV show has some funny moments but neither of these can be compred to the movie.I truly recommend it.
" Interview with vampire OFFICE.
",2019-06-08 00:00:00,10,"I dont usually give 10/10 to films.
Alien(1979) is 10/10 because it revolutionized the horror genre.
LOTR Trilogy is 10/10 because its one of the best media in the world.

" Dry dark but definitely funny
",2019-06-03 00:00:00,8,"REVIEW - WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWSWhilst watching BBC2 the other evening I turned over to a program that was half way through but I instantly found the day dark humour funny and watched until the end. After searching for the title of the program I found it to be a US program made from the original film of the same name made in New Zealand.Sitting watching the film again the dry dark humour appealed.Basically a TV documentary crew are documenting the life of a group of vampires who live together and their lives, loves, victims and friends.Gets pretty surreal at times with the vampires trying to live in modern day social, like trying to get ready to go out on the town.Personally I just loved the whole idea and found this very original film to be a scream and am now watching the TV series.Bloody in places (they are vampires) swearing but definitely dry, dark and funny.Rating 8 out of 10"
" The Best Vampire Movie Out There
",2019-06-03 00:00:00,10,"As close to perfect this kind of movie can be. Great comedy in a unique style and an excellent use of the ""mockumentary style"" type of filming. The actors are very comfortable in theur roles.It's well worth your time, I promise."
" Great

" Pure hilarity!
",2019-05-25 00:00:00,10,"A mocumentary about vampire roommates who just want to fit in the modern world and have a, sort of, normal life. Plain and simply, a hilarious movie executed to perfection. The characters are incredible, the actors are amazing, the editing makes it seem like it is a real life documentary and the script is one of the funniest I have ever seen! The laughs just keep coming with this one. It throws all the vampire cliches in the 21th century, lampooning all of the troupes people came to expect from vampire movies. Just an amazing piece of comedy and film-making."
" I was wrong this film is amazing and very funny
",2019-05-25 00:00:00,10,"Back when this came out I gave it a miss because it sounded dumb but few years later I realised it got a bit of a cult following so checked the trailer again I got put off than I watched the amazing Thor Ragnarok and found out it was directed by the same guy and so 2019 I finally got round to watching it and boy was I wrong, the film blew me away I went into it knowing absolutely nothing about it and yet start to end I was hooked and laughed throughout the movie the jokes were wow and did not get old and though the plot was weak the movie made up for it with great characters excellent humour and a tremendous final"
" Genius
",2019-05-23 00:00:00,10,Best comedy I've seen in the last 10 yrs. So smart and the cast is absolutely brilliant
" It's bloody brilliant
",2019-04-27 00:00:00,9,"I have precious little time for mockumentaries apart from those that come from Christopher Guest and ensemble. However, this is one worth watching. It's silly and gory, but, utterly entertaining and, at times, quite sweet, but, best of all, it's genuinely funny.
The cast are excellent, the Vampires are each clearly based of famous cinematic Vampires so you can identify with them. And can I say, I really love Stu.
All I can really say is that you should give it a go."
" Not So Dark Shadows
",2019-04-11 00:00:00,9,"If you are a fan of ""Flight of the Conchords' then you will love this movie currently on Netflix. Written and directed by Jemaine Clement (the larger looming but no less adorable half of the 'Conchords') and Taika Waititi (who breathed new life into the 'Thor' franchise directing 'Thor: Ragnarok'), this film combines our seemingly immortal fascination with vampire lore with the deft and unprepossessing comic sensibilities of New Zealand, all packaged in the satirical style of a mockumentary. Karen O'Leary and Mike Minogue stand out as the affable and mildly paternalistic police constables. Rhys Darby (Murray, the band manager from 'Conchords') is hilarious as the leader of a wolf pack that is more wolf support group. The movie spun off two television series; 'Wellington Paranormal' in New Zealand and an American version of 'Shadows' . Both equally as funny."
" A great surprise
",2019-04-05 00:00:00,8,It's fun to give a movie you know nothing about a try and wind up genuinely entertained. That's what happened here. The film is hilarious.
" Waititi and Clement's well-earned place in the classic horror pantheon
",2019-04-04 00:00:00,10,"I watched my first horror films during the Nixon era, and over the ensuing years got so sick of vampires and werewolves and horror comedy in general that by the time this came along I ignored it. I only got interested after finding out that one of the leads played Tamatoa in ""Moana"" and another directed an Avengers film. There is solid star power in this little movie which lifts it above the ordinary, but everything about it is extremely well done, from story and acting to special effects. Whether or not you find it laugh out loud funny depends on how much you like its ""Flight of the Conchords"" style bro comedy, but I've always believed that at the heart of the best comedy is good theater, and this is eminently watchable as such.Where horror parody usually falls down is by not really understanding what it's purporting to be making fun of. WWDITS makes intelligent references to ""Nosferatu,"" ""Lost Boys"" and Francis Ford Coppola's ""Dracula"" (and I'm sure the makers knew WWDITS' English cousin ""Being Human"" backwards and forwards) but it genuinely has the texture and atmosphere of a Gothic horror piece. The existential absurdity of the vampire's life is confronted in a way most other vampire stories are too busy or shallow to even touch. It also uses the aesthetics of low budget horror in a craftful way that I'd thought had been forgotten decades ago.I have no hope that the new TV series based on this property will retain the charms of the original. Although Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi are involved as directors and writers, they will definitely be missed in front of the camera."
" Brilliant...
",2019-03-31 00:00:00,9,I love a mocumentary style comedy. I also love Vampire movies. I was hoping that this would be well done. I should never have doubted. It's almost perfect. The character studies are almost genius. The backstories. The nuances. The sets. And it's hilarious. Brilliant.
" A sign of great things to come ... flawed but funny
",2019-03-29 00:00:00,7,"I'm late to this party, and seeing it for the first time in 2019 it's easy to see the seeds of what led Taika Waititito get the Marvel gig (and execute it so brilliantly). Amongst all (sub) genres, comedy-horror is one of the hardest to get right; the film needs to be both a proper comedy and also a proper horror movie to really work, and take both genres at face-value. Shaun Of The Dead executes this near flawlessly; What We Do In The Shadows does well, but not quite enough for me. The documentary format - whilst a good joke - means it leans more on the comedy, and hence isn't really horror enough. The horror elements play almost as Hammer at its worst, which may or may not be intentional, but distracts from the nuanced performances. Some of the gags are brilliant - the verbal comedy, the physical, the nods to other films and especially the good natured, self aware fun with the rules and tropes of vampirism. Occasionally it hints towards bigger themes - homophobia, for instance. That would be a good fit; vampire stories are almost always about sex or sexuality in some way. The 'coming out' scene is inspired; the scenes of bullying in the street both funny and moving. But the theme never quite takes the theme far enough; it feels like one of a bunch of ideas thrown at the wall until something sticks. The film lacks an ultimate emotional punch for which it strives, and I'm left with the feeling that the newly-launching spin-off TV series might be the best format for this. It's good, of course, and has much re-watch value and quotability ... but the director had better ahead of him."
" It works. Kinda.
",2019-03-25 00:00:00,5,"The concept is a fun one but leaves too much open. Nonetheless its a fun idea. Sadly the only fun thing i saw in the entire film before i had to stop watching it. The setting is too brutal to be ""realistic"". So much so that it calls the entire concept into question and makes jokes that would otherwise have worked fall flat. Its a great idea and the effort is visible but the acting is too much ""wink wink nudge nudge"" and tge atmosphere too uncomfortable.
It's not bad and all its parts are basically functional but it's too mundane for a horror spoof and too gruesome for a lighthearted comedy.In short: A lot of very good parts, decent acting, great concepts and ideas, and good humour are ruined by a dissonant and unimmersive tone"
" SUPER FUNNY!!
",2019-03-24 00:00:00,10,"I never even heard of this film until the Syfy channel started showing commercials for their upcoming TV series for this show, which I will DEFINITIVELY be watching!!I assume the writers and creators of this show were some of the same people who make ""People of Earth"" which was also a really good horror comedy TV show. I wish they made a 2nd season, it was REALLY FUNNY, silly, and good!!"
" Hilarious
",2019-03-18 00:00:00,9,"Taika Waititi shines as a young director (now becoming world famous) and one of the main actors along with Jemain Clement (Flight of the Conchords) in this fantastic farce. They show how to create something memorable on a very low budget. Destined to be a cult classic, it certainly is one of my all-time favorites."
" Endearing and really funny
",2019-03-13 00:00:00,9,"I watched this on my teenage son's recommendation so I wasn't expecting too much, but it was really funny from start to finish. A great story which is touching in parts. You end up loving all the characters especially Stu. I highly recommend."
" In a class with Rocky Horror & other midnite gems
",2019-03-10 00:00:00,5,This low budget gem from New Zealand is a classic. Even a mediocre TV remake will bring it more fans.
" Hilarious
",2019-02-16 00:00:00,10,Best comedy I've seen in decades. Cast is incredible. It's one of those movies you can watch over and over again. Now I know most of the lines 😁
" This movie sucks so bad and that isn't supposed to be a pun.

" All about Stu.
",2019-02-06 00:00:00,8,"'What We Do In The Shadows (2014)' is pretty much the best 'mockumentary' I've seen, especially in terms of its 'documentary' aesthetic. From the subtle camera-light illuminating the characters to the expert use of story-telling stock-photos to a brilliant black-and-white 'recreation', this film feels like a 'real' documentary right the way through. This is contrary to most movies of the kind, which usually lose their way in the second act or break the illusion with impossible shots that should reveal the camera-men but don't. It's also the main reason, I feel, why the experience works so well. Everything just feels so 'real' and the satire is certainly on-point. The piece pokes fun at all types of vampire and their tropes, using its five core bloodsuckers to take specific aim at archetypes seen within 'Nosfetstu (1922)', 'Dracula (1931)', 'Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992)', 'Interview With The Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles (1994)' and 'Twilight (2008)'. Of course, it also jabs at various clichés from across the myriad of movies that make use of the wider vampire mythos. On top of all this, it pokes fun at both typical 'flat-mate' youth-culture and documentaries at large, so it has quite a lot to sink its teeth into. Thankfully, it hits a deep vein. It's remarkably funny on numerous occasions. Even when it isn't 'laugh-out-loud', its satire is more than clever enough to be appreciated. It paints a believable portrait of modern-day vampires in a way that works even if you haven't seen a horror movie before - though, obviously the experience is infinitely enhanced if you have. It's performances are actually quite subtle; they're remarkably restrained and wonderfully wholistic considering that they consist of mainly improvised material. The same can be said of the entire affair, I suppose, as it tells a cohesive, if ever-so-slightly 'skit'-based story. The special-effects are also remarkably good. They're consistently convincing and incredibly imaginative. On the whole, this is a very entertaining feature with a unique central conceit that's executed in a charming and suitably low-key way. It's smart, funny and generally likeable. 8/10"
" HILARIOUS and fun!
",2019-01-29 00:00:00,9,"What I love most about this movie is how free and easygoing it is, in my opinion. It's funny, but the jokes don't barrel you over repeatedly, they give you enough time to have your laugh over one joke before going to the next. There's a fair amount of drama and action, but its important to the plot, and builds up interesting tension before the climax. Everything in this movie is very well strung together, beautifully acted out, and I fell in love with most all of the characters before the movie even came to the halfway point. The ONLY negative side I could ever give to this movie was that it felt so short, and I was left wishing it could last just a little longer, even if the movie already is 90 minutes. But they added in everything they could, it was all that was needed to impress and I can heartily say that anyone who hasn't seen this movie is missing out on a lot of fun.Movie warnings: It contains gore, mild/moderate horror themes, sexual innuendos, blurred-out nudity, violence, and plenty of cursing, so this movie is probably not for children. The jokes will fly over their heads and the visuals will scare them. But teenagers and adults will love this movie; I recommend watching it in a group so you can have a barrel of laughs with all your friends, because it is just too good to watch alone."
" Glimpses of genius.....
",2019-01-26 00:00:00,9,"Throughout the entire film. The film was quirky thoughout & amusing, but there were moment of pure genius that made me LOL and that doesn't happen often.A must see, really."
" One of the funniest films I've seen
",2019-01-17 00:00:00,8,"From Taika Waititi, What We Do is a mockumentary of vampire flat-mates that is as funny as any film you'll see. It's strongest in its first 3/4's, and I must give my pick for favorite character to Petyr. It's just pure fun, and is an early reminder of the talent that Waititi is."
" Extremely funny
",2019-01-15 00:00:00,10,This perfectly cast mock-doc never sags in its wit and forward momentum. I laughed all the way through and I believe it is one of my all-time favourite comedies.
" Underrated and more should see this movie
",2019-01-05 00:00:00,10,An amazing movie in the indie style. It plays homage to traditional comedy as well as traditional horror. Each cast member exceeded Expectation for a glorious romp through the lives of vampires in modern society
" I LOOOOVE this movie!
",2019-01-05 00:00:00,10,"I loved this movie and have watched it several times.I laughed several times before the opening credits, and that type of humor is the humor throughout. If you appreciate Modern Family, you will likely appreciate this movie. It has a similar type of style and humor.This is one of my all-time favorite movies. Soooooo funny!"
" Hilarious
",2018-12-30 00:00:00,10,Best comedy I've seen in a long time. Love the cast. Would love to see a sequel. This is by far one of my favorite comedies 😁
" A fun twist on the vampire genre
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,8,"What We Do in the Shadows is a highly entertaining take on the vampire genre. The cast of this mockumentary obviously had a good time making it, and it shows. This movie isn't non-stop laughs, but there are plenty of humorous moments to enjoy. I will definitely be thinking about this movie the next time I see a vampire onscreen."
" Okay
",2018-12-19 00:00:00,6,"A fictional documentary exposes the day-to-day lives of four vampires sharing a home in Wellington, New Zealand.The movie begins awkwardly in an amateurish way. This was probably intentional but, at least for the first half-hour, it comes off as bad frat-boy material.Once getting used to it, though, it at least has consistency and the humour begins to take effect especially as the vampires get mixed up with witches, werewolves, humans, and other entities.Rather light but harmless. - dbamateurcritic"
" Great
",2018-12-16 00:00:00,10,Not many movies can make me laugh. This one did. Great dry humor mockumentary. Will definitely watch again down the road.
" A good mockumentary
",2018-12-06 00:00:00,10,"I like this mockumentary more Than ""This Is Spinal Tap"". Perhaps because this title really seems to have a lot of improvisation by the actors. The actors are very well picked.
And in all - one of my favourite comedies of all time."
" So much fun!
",2018-12-05 00:00:00,8,"This movie is hilarious. Such a fun watch. I loved all of the characters and how they interacted with one another. Vampires are an old favorite of mine and it was great being able to laugh at the day-to-day lives of five vampires. I loved how Deacon was so casual about how Petyr turned him into a vampire, to the point where they had been living together for who knows how long. I also loved Vladislav's backstory - not about his ex, but about how badass he used to be. Viago was of course just a goofball. This film had me laughing throughout, I would definitely recommend it."
" Busted a gut at least 7 times.
",2018-11-27 00:00:00,10,"The title of this movie sounded so ominous that I couldn't resist watching. Within the first 10 minutes I was laughing out loud. This is one of the funniest films I've seen in a long time. Every character was hilarious, and even Petyr, who looked absolutely terrifying, was a laugh riot. How can four vampires living in the same flat make everything look so funny? It was gory, scary, very clever and totally unexpected. I'll be watching it again very soon just to make sure I didn't miss anything."

Similar to the joke a second ""Airplane"" style movies, mockumentaries seemed destined to dwell in a land of talentless hacks looking for an easy movie to make on a low budget.So what does What We Do in the Shadows do differently than other recent mockumentaries. Well, it is laugh out loud funny... yeah, I am going to go with that.Okay fine, good acting, excellent story and premise, fresh takes on well-worn tropes and plenty of surprises.

" It's Impossible to Kill the Comedy At Stake in This Vampire Romp
",2018-11-21 00:00:00,8,"The mid-00s saw the rise of reality-TV style comedies, chiefly with the popularity of the British and American versions of ""The Office"", which involved humor based around awkward situations, misunderstandings, and petty social drama rather than the more plot-driven style of a traditional sitcom. ""What We Do in The Shadows"" by New Zealand-based director Taika Waititi answers the absurd question of what if that dynamic and style was applied to vampires and the world of the supernatural?Full disclosure: I'm not the biggest fan of horror in general (with some exceptions), and certainly not a fan of vampires. The vampire concept, its romanticization, and how seriously the vampire sub-genre takes itself has always made it a ripe target for satire and comedy, with Leslie Nielsen and Mel Brooks doing a great job of mocking it in ""Dracula: Dead and Loving It"". Waititi's project takes that same satirical spirit and plants it in the modern aesthetic, with plenty of hand-held camerawork and confessional cam scenes that you've seen on your favorite garbage reality shows.It's expertly executed, and after close to a decade of vomit-inducing Twilight sequels and vampire fetishizing, sorely needed. ""What We Do.."" shows vampires from what's arguably the most realistic viewpoint ever seen on film, with daily (nightly?) routines filled with their own unique mundane frustrations and challenges, as well as social complications like who to convert to a vampire, and who to simply prey upon. You can tell watching it that the crew improvised a great deal, and the whole production has an organic, natural energy to it filled with fun.
""What We Do"" doesn't completely stilt itself on gags, goofiness, and satire though. It has surprisingly well-done special effects and gore scenes, and also draws effective portraits of all the characters, and develops them in their own silly, petty, and sometimes surprisingly endearing ways.I think Taiki Waititi struck gold with this concept and applying such a pedestrian mood to what's supposed to be terrifying. It's not perfect, and towards the end of the second act of the film, at least on my first viewing, it began to drag and stretch a little, with the concept starting to wear thin in places. Luckily, there's enough of a story arc to bring you back in, and it wraps up neatly before it feels stale. Overall, even if you don't have the contempt and fatigue from vampires I do, even if you love them in fact, I would recommend ""What We Do.."" Because copies, homages, inspiration, and blatant rip-offs are so common in the film industry, one of the only things I'm worried about is other filmmakers, especially Hollywood-types, borrowing the concept from this production and trying to pass it off as clever and original, since no major Hollywood stars feature in ""What We Do..."" and it might not have as high of a profile. Or even worse, a remake. Now the thought of that is truly terrifying."
" Bloody brilliant
",2018-11-21 00:00:00,10,"This is a superb comedy. It was written, directed and performed brilliantly. If you don't laugh at this you are probably dead inside. I am at a loss for superlatives because there are not enough to elevate this work of comedic art to the pinnacle of entertaining cinema."
" My favorite movie, hands down.
",2018-11-10 00:00:00,10,This movie will make you laugh til you cry. It's a cult favorite among my friend group (age 29) and we watch it a few times a year. The subtleties make this movie perfection. Put your phone down and really watch it and you won't be disappointed.

Oh, and they're also vampires.Filmed by a documentary crew, our nocturnal friends go through their nightly routines. Their personalities are quite different, which makes them more interesting. Vladislav is the Dracula-type (Think: Vlad The Impaler), looking and sounding very Transylvanian. Viago is more of a gentle sort, not wanting to cause problems. He was a ""dandy"" when he was alive. Deacon is the more ""cool"", ""hip"" bloodsucker. If Keith Moon had become a vampire, this is what he would be! He knits his own sweaters as well. Petyr is the classic Nosferatu of the group, sealed in his concrete coffin in the cellar.As we watch these undead, they take us along on a dark journey into... hilarity! WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS is one of the best mockumentaries since THIS IS SPINAL TAP. As interesting as it is uproarious, it's certainly better than any ""real"" reality TV show.Some highlights include: Group discussions about the household chores, encounters with the local werewolf pack, the ""human"" incident at The Unholy Masquerade, and many more!For lovers of humor, who happen to like vampires too. The perfect Halloween confection!..."
" GREAT movie. Never gets old.
",2018-09-16 00:00:00,10,"Original, fun, hilarious, intriguing. I never get sick of this movie. The humor is funny every time I watch it. Never gets old."
" Good to watch with friends
",2018-09-14 00:00:00,7,"Summary: 
This movie is a mockumentary movie about a group of 4 vampires called Deacon, Viago, Petyr and Vladislav. They are flatmates in New Zealand and they invite a documentary crew to film their daily activities that are very similar to our lives but with a vampire twist, like bringing people home from nightclubs to suck their blood, or going to undead festivals.. What I like: 
This is one of the funniest movies that I have ever seen. Normally I never laugh at movies, I just get amused, but this one I was laughing every few minutes, it's exactly my type of humour. 
The funniest moments only work with the expert delivery by Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi who star in the movie as Viago and Vladislav as well as writing and directing it. If you told most of the jokes to someone they probably wouldn't get it but with the awkward pauses and absurdity that you see and hear in the movie, it makes you laugh every time.What I dislike:
The way that the story is structured it just seems like a series of skits with some connection in the story and personally I prefer stories with more of a plot. I would have also prefered if we got to see more of what the 4 main vampires lives where like in other time periods"
" Vampires meet documentary
",2018-09-11 00:00:00,10,"What a refreshing film! What we do in the shadows is one of the most original films in the last several years, I enjoyed everything about this movie, the characters were funny, the story is gripping, and the overall idea is just spectacular! This is one of those films that you don't have to give much thought to, you can just sit back and enjoy!"
" Better lovestory than Twilight
",2018-09-01 00:00:00,8,"This film is pretty great. Although it starts out fairly slow, the performances and comedy we're great. Being a mockumentary gives this movie a lot more freedom to do what it wants, and even though there is no specific plotline to the story I never felt bored. I do have a few problems with this movie concerning some small pacing or plot convenience problems but it is never anything that can take away your enjoyment of the film. If you like vampires or the concept of a comedy driven mockumentary about vampires I would say give it a watch."
" Brilliant!
",2018-08-22 00:00:00,10,A work of art. So well made. Dry. Fun. Constant flow keeping it fresh. This movie has it all. Virgins. Sexy vampires. An IT specialist. A Chicken. Even spinal columns!

",2018-07-20 00:00:00,10,"This mockumentary about four vampires sharing a house in Wellington, NZ is one of the funniest films I've seen in years. 
At first I was skeptical. When I read the storyline it sounded dreadful; unoriginal, too similar to ""Being Human"", so I put off watching it. Then, after a couple of friends recommended it, I thought I'd give it a chance. I'm so glad I did. It was hilarious, and the dialogue and delivery is spot on. It captures the documentary ""look"" perfectly too. 
I think ""What We Do in the Shadows"" is to vampire movies what ""Shaun of the Dead"" is to zombie flicks. It's brilliant."
" Excellent, original, fun
",2018-07-10 00:00:00,9,"This is one very amusing movie. Not taking itself too seriously, but managing to bring freshness and originality and many many new angles to the vampire genre. It is witty, it looks nice and is wholeheartedly recommended."
" Glorious
",2018-07-03 00:00:00,6,"What a movie! It's so fresh, funny and strange! That's a perfect recipe for a cult movie. When you love vampire, you want to spend some time in the darkness with them. You want to know how they live, how it is. The movie is directed as if you were with them in the shadow. It's definitely the kind of movie you want to watch again and again."

" This is one sweet, fresh-smelling dead horse!
",2018-05-29 00:00:00,9,"Loved it. Anyone who can take not just one trope (vampires, oooo!) but TWO (mockumentaries! So 90s!) and make it fun is a winner in my book. From the awkward, tooth-baring grins of the first introductory shots, to the panicking werewolves trying to find the right tree or the combination for a padlock before the moon is up, this indy gem had me paying attention and chuckling the whole time. Yes, vampires are overdone. So what? This was a vampire movie we really haven't seen before, and that alone makes it special. Add in the quality of the humor and the decent visual effects, and it becomes more than special - it becomes (drum roll, please) A CANDIDATE FOR CULT CLASSIC STATUS. ""Bat fight! Bat fight!"" actually made me laugh out loud.If you're a fan of comedy, see this movie. If you're a fan of vampires, see this movie. If you're bored and want something unique, see this movie. And on, and on, and on. Just do yourself a favor and see it."

The concept is hilarious & I love how the characters interact and how they are all different ""types "" of vampires from popular culture. The writing had me in stitches. ""Vampires don't but down towels first"". The whole werewolf, witch, vampire etc subculture is hilarious. Like rival gangs between vampires & werewolves so so funny. Granted this kind of movie isn't for everyone but if you like a mockumentarylook no further!"

" Funny as hell.
",2018-03-01 00:00:00,8,"This movie is pretty funny, which is the main thing that its got going for it. I greatly enjoyed it. If you are planning to watch it, don't forget to stay around until the very end to see the end-credits scene. The rest of this review is going to be broken up into parts so that you can see where I stand on each element of it. Effects - The effects were pretty bad for the most part, though I did think that the flying looked decent. There is a scene with werewolves, and the costumes are terrible. However, the smart decision to keep them out-of-focus and in the dark for as long as possible was made and it didn't take away from the scene to much when the camera focused long enough to show the audience the embarrassing suits. Cinematography - This movie gets a bit of a pass as its style is that of a mockumentary. There are a few scenes where the cameraman moves a bit faster than he should to get lots of different angles. You could say that there are more than one cameramen (which there are) but they would've been visible in the other shots. It took me out of the movie a bit since the only way to achieve the effect they got is by having the cameraman move around between takes to film a scene in real time from multiple angles. If the cameramen were a bit more visible, the documentary-style presentation would've been a bit more believable. Ignoring that, its actually shot and put together very well (ignoring the bad CGI).Audio - There are some bits where characters are cleaning their shirts and you can hear the sound of something brushing a mike, implying that the vampires have mikes. The audio quality is pretty good throughout the whole movie, but where is seems to be coming form is a bit inconsistent. At no point can you see mikes on the characters, and there's never any mention of them. Its a bit odd. Not the worst thing ever, but it kinda bugged me. Comedy - Comedy is a bit subjective. Everyone finds different things funny. I though that this was a funny movie. I liked the situations, I thought the punchlines were well-delivered. Overall I was laughing throughout the whole thing. The Plot - There is a plot. Its not the greatest plot, sure, but it is coherent. Its a bit loose and simple, but it works well in a movie heavily reliant on gags. The plot is mostly just the life of a few characters over what seems to be the course of about a year. Its funny and entertaining and isn't trying to be something that its not. The Characters - Not all the characters have as much development as they could've had in this short movie, but the performances are good and they all play off of each other making the jokes work. This was not my favorite movie of all time, but I enjoyed it and would recommend it. This is a movie worth watching. Though its short, you're sure to enjoy the time it takes to watch - provided that this is the type of humor you enjoy. If not, I don't know what to tell you."
" What We Do In The Shadows highlights the quirky comedic wit of Taika Waititi.
",2018-02-24 00:00:00,7,"A man who has rocketed to mainstream fame with 'Thor: Ragnarok', however I find his previous lesser known work to be more enthralling and creatively unique. A faux documentary of a small group of vampires who share a house together. We view their nightly lives but also welcoming a new younger member to the vampiric clan. Have you ever wondered what vampires get up to except sleeping in coffins and drinking the blood of a virgin? Well, this film explores that in the best way possible: comedically. There's nothing funny about a vampire...but a vampire residing in New Zealand? That's a whole different story. It's impossible not to admire the type of eccentric humour that is put into Waititi's films. Quick, sharp and full of wit, the dialogue remains intelligent throughout without having to resort to slapstick. Burst veins causing blood to spray, bat fights, werewolf clans and even the hierarchal structure of master and familiar. Traditional vampiric routines with a hint of edgy fun. Also liked the reference to other vampire films like 'The Lost Boys' and the horrifically terrible 'Twilight'. Did I laugh all the way through? No. Is it as funny as everyone claims it to be? Definitely not. Though the creativity in every scene makes the flick scarily entertaining. Waititi, Clement and Brugh have fang-tastic on screen chemistry. The costume design was authentic, heck even the visual effects were pretty decent considering the low budget. A nice short runtime results in a consistent pace that moves along rapidly. I would've liked to have seen more of a plot offered to keep me enthralled, but I appreciate the direction Waititi and Clement took. A fun intriguing look into the life of a vampire with plenty of comedic wit, albeit slightly overrated. Atleast I laughed at this, shows that I have more life than a vampire!"
" Absolutely hilarious!
",2018-02-23 00:00:00,10,"What huge surprise that we stumbled across this movie! So clever and original with so many scenes and lines remembered long after.
One of the best comedies we have seen.
Others have described the plot and characters, but all I can say is watch this wonderful film!"
" Wonderful Vampire Mockumentary
",2018-02-17 00:00:00,10,"""What We Do in the Shadows"" is a fantastic New Zealand vampire mockumentary, no surprise considering Taika Waititi (""Thor Ragnarok"" director) and ""Flight of the Conchords'"" Jermaine Clement are involved.""...Shadows"" is about a vampire sharehouse in Wellington, New Zealand - Viago (Waititi), Vladislav (Clement), Deacon (Jonny Brugh) and the 800-year-old Petyr (Ben Fransham) - filmed for a documentary. Their relatively cosy existence is interrupted when 20-year-old Nick (Cori Gonzalez-Macuer) is turned into a vampire and moves into the sharehouse, visited by his human best friend Stu (Stu Rutherford). Stu is such a likeable guy that the vampires - despite their hunger - refuse to eat him.The highlight of the movie is the dry New Zealand humour (similar to Conchords') contrasting the fantastical vampiric lore, with Stu - who works with Geodatabases - teaching the vampires about computers and mobiles. Other highlights are the werewolves, with Rhys Darby playing the alpha male Anton, and the clueless local police.Arguably the best vampire comedy since Leslie Nielsen's ""Dracula: Dead and Loving It"", ""...Shadows"" is a welcome contrast from the wave of more serious vampire-themed TV series and movies.With Waititi gaining recognition after ""Thor Ragnarok"", hopefully curious fans will check out ""...Shadows"". It's well worth it. The good news is an American TV series is planned, so hopefully it does the movie justice."
" Is this supposed to be funny?
",2018-01-18 00:00:00,2,"So I reluctantly decided to watch this film, that had oh such good ratings from critics and audiences alike. What did I see?Well, level of production inferior to some of YouTube videos nowadays, for starters. Everything looks dirt-cheap with laughable effects and poor camera work. I read that the budget was 1.6 million dollars, yet it looks 1.59 million dollars cheaper.But it's not just about the looks, right? It's a comedy, after all, it's the writing that matters! Well unfortunately the jokes here are pure sh*t mostly. It's all dirt-cheap puns about how werewolves act like dogs, so they smell and run after sticks. Or how these guys are vampires, so they can't wear silver necklases as it burns, and they bite people. Oh wow, my belly just hurts so much from all the laughter. There's also some unnecessary vulgarity, which doesn't really help anything.The only reasons this was not a 1/10 are that were like 2 moderately amusing gags, and the whole thing lasts less than an hour and a half, so while it is a tedious bore, it's not as long as it could've been. I heard about this movie after its director and writer Taika Waititi (or whatever) was praised for ""bringing his charm and wit"" to Thor Ragnarok, which I'm yet to watch. Well if Thor Ragnarok has the same level of humor as this than it's likely also borderline unwatchable trash.After the credits one of the characters says something along the lines of ""You will forget the contents of this movie"". I wish I did, honestly."
" It's a Clever Concept Executed Smartly and Packaged Wonderfully
",2017-12-13 00:00:00,8,"When I heard that there's another movie about vampires, it won't catch my interest anymore, until this! It's so smart, the plot and storyline are simple but clever, it makes you want to know more about the characters and their lives (wait, they're undead, so it's supposedly 'deaths'). Each character gives more life to the story, their relationship is lovely. It actually portrays the basic basic things in life, but because it's another world, it becomes interesting. However, also thumbs up to the execution and packaging of the idea, it won't be as interesting if it's not done well. The documentary style, the dialogue, the whole of it is just nice to be followed. I can see how this will be easily a popular series if it's invested better. Seriously, it's so clever. You'd want to watch more!!!"
" A Hilarious, Delightful 90 Minutes,
",2017-11-14 00:00:00,9,"What We Do in the Shadows is a terrific movie with a very well written plot and a tremendous comedic cast. It is a ridiculously fun, original comedy film as we follow a group of vampires in a documentary style, getting to see what a regular week is like for them. It does this mockumentary take in a way that is fresh and not in any way repetitive or similar to other ones, we feel like these vampires are really people, while also being in hysterics. My only genuine complaint about this movie is that it was too short. Running at just under ninety minutes, I was a little underwhelmed at how abruptly it finished, I felt it could have gone further, more could have happened. The cast is absolutely phenomenal, with everyone having an effortless comedic presence, great chemistry and owning their roles individually. Taika Waititi, Jemaine Clement and Jonathan Brugh shine in their respective roles, and the back and forth between them is so good that it is hard to tell what bits are improvised and what are scripted. Pure hilarity from beginning to end. A complete riot, What We do in the Shadows is great fun, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy. Follows a group of vampires living in the same household, coping with their mundane day to day lives. Best Performance: Jemaine Clement"
" Not really that funny
",2017-11-12 00:00:00,4,"Your enjoyment of WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS, a Kiwi vampire comedy, really depends on how funny you find the characters. Me, I didn't laugh once, and found the funniest this got was the odd sense of mild amusement at best. Essentially this mockumentary takes the successful format of THE OFFICE - a constant yet unseen cameraman shooting a documentary, with awkward asides and glances at the lens - and mixes it with a vampire spoof in which centuries-old vampires strive to cope with the issues of everyday life. Horror fans will be delighted to see that the main vampires are all based on cinematic legend - Bela Lugosi and Gary Oldman's Draculas are here, and the best of the bunch is a version of Nosferatu - but the actors give performances which feel forced, and I found the whole thing more than a little cumbersome."
" Love at first bite
",2017-11-04 00:00:00,6,"Directors Taika Waititi and Jermaine Clement also star in this low budget mockumentary of a group of vampires sharing a house in modern day New Zealand.They argue about housework, they have a slave who do various tasks for them including getting victims round for dinner and some blood.The vampires hit the town at night to go to nightclubs to maybe find victims for blood, but they really are the oldest rockers in town ill suited to the 21st century.They also fall foul of other mutants such as a pack of werewolves that they can smell from a mile off.Waititi & Clement have fun picking apart the vampire conventions, checking for daylight the first thing to do when they wake up in the evening, make sure the blood of the victims do not get everywhere when the victims are attacked, even hypnotism and flying.Things take a turn when a victim called Nick becomes a vampire. He invites a human friend to stay with them. Nick also boasts to strangers that he is a vampire which leads to Petyr, the oldest vampire to being killed.For vampire Viago it is also a sad love story who followed his true love but got posted elsewhere.The film is a good combination of absurdness, humour and horror which can be bloody. However the comedy is rather one note."
" ""Say hello to the night, Lost in the shadows, Say hello to the night, Lost in the loneliness.""
",2017-11-02 00:00:00,9,"Whilst sadly getting no Trick or Treaters,I started looking for a Horror movie to watch to mark Halloween. Reading praise for the title from a number of IMDbers over the years,I was pleased to see the BBC screening the movie,which led to me finding out what they do in the shadows.The plot:Preparing to attend the yearly masquerade ball of witches,vampires and zombies, vampires Viago, Vladislav, Deacon, and Petyr and the 8,000 year old Count Orlok allow a documentary crew to come in and film them over the lead-up to the ball. Letting the film crew shoot all their daily routines, Deacon gets his human servant Jackie to bring two random in for them to feed on.Draining the woman, the gang chase after the man,but are stopped in their tracks,when Orlok appears,and appears to have the man all for himself. The next night, Viago, Petyr, Vladislav and Deacon discover that instead of killing him,Orlok has turned the man into a new member of the gang.View on the film:Put together from 125 hours edited down to 90 minutes (!) the outline co-writers/co-directors/co-stars Jemaine Clement & Taika Waititi works incredibly well,thanks to the (largely improvised) gags being based around the building of the friendship between all of the vampires and the fall-out from their trip to the masquerade ball. Basing each vampire off specific vamps from famous films,Clement and Waititi bring out superb character comedy in the awkward differences each vamp shares,from the classical romantic Viago,to the modern day pretty boy Nick. Bringing the life of the vamps to a light in a Found Footage format,the directors do occasionally break the rule of the genre with unnatural camera positions,but make up for it by the dashing tracking shots stabbing the flick with an urgency of each punch-line being caught in the moment. Keeping the budget low,Clement and Waititi cleverly use CGI effects sparingly in order to sink their fangs into the relationships,with smoothly handled CGI transformations matching the transformations taking place within the gang. Entering as outsiders, Stu Rutherford (who was originally hired to work on the CGI!) and Cori Gonzalez-Macuer give great dead- pan performances as Stu and Nick,whilst Waititi and Vladislav hilariously layer on the Gothic flamboyance as Vladislav and Viago,who get lost in the shadows."
" mildly amusing
",2017-11-02 00:00:00,5,"I watched this for about half an hour. A mockumentary about vampire roommates is a cute idea, mixing the day-to-day challenges of shared living with vampire challenges like finding victims, and it was all kind of amusing. But I wouldn't go so far as to call it funny, and the fact that I wasn't actually laughing or feeling interested hinted to me that this wasn't the movie for me.It's very low-key humor. It's so low-key that even the moments that might feel horrific instead just seem bland. In theory, this is a dark comedy, but it never felt that dark or that funny. To be fair, I don't like some mockumentaries that other people love. While I loved Spinal Tap, I never understood the appeal of Waiting for Guffman. So if you just love all the mockumentaries, you might like this better than I did."
" Literally the funniest movie I've ever seen! LOVED it!
",2017-10-23 00:00:00,10,This movie is absolutely brilliant! i've watched it a few times and i still enjoy it and laugh out loud every single time. makes me wish these vampires were for real :) The actors are doing an amazing job and the directing and acting are simply brilliant. i hope there will be a sequel or a TV show with these guys cause i cant have enough of them.
" Dead... but delicious!
",2017-09-12 00:00:00,8,"Pretty dang funny! Four vampires share a flat in New Zealand, and this mockumentary follows them! (Petyr was my favorite - totally old school!) The more you ""know"" about vampires, the more you'll enjoy this! And there are werewolves too - Werewolves, not Swear-Wolves! This is fun and very well made! ""Dead but delicious""!"
" Biting comedy
",2017-09-11 00:00:00,8,"A clever 'mockumentary' that follows the travails of four vampires sharing a house in modern Wellington NZ, ""What We Do in the Shadows"" tags many of the tropes associated with the vampire myth as the foursome struggle to get along and get enough to drink. The film is largely a 'big in-joke' and aficionados of the genre will recognise each of bloodsuckers from movies/books but even if vampires are not your cup of blood, it is still pretty funny. Some of the jokes and sight-gags work better than others but the best parts are brilliant: especially the interactions with the vampires' immortal enemies, the werewolves. Be forewarned: at times the movie is a bit crude (even the werewolves are swear-wolves at times) and gruesome (four guys who drink blood sharing a house, what do you think the kitchen looks like?). Best line: Vlad, on using the legendary sexuality of the vampire to attract prey ""I am the bait and the trap."""
" Hilarious
",2017-07-20 00:00:00,10,"I find comedy's a bit hit and miss these days. A lot have a couple of laughs here and there and overall pleasant to watch, HOWEVER, this movie had me laughing from start to finish. Taking a bunch or lads who are sharing a flat, throw in all the normal issues and arguments they have, AND make them vampires........brilliant. The lines were funny, the characters were great and the effects were good too. I definitely recommend this if you have a dry sense of humour and find the likes of ""The Office"" funny."
" Vastly Overrated and Not that Funny
",2017-07-11 00:00:00,5,"Maybe it is because I'm not a fan of the horror genre or vampire movies, but I found this film tedious and with sparse bits of mild amusement tossed in.This isn't Spinal Tap with fangs. The actors try their best at deadpan comedy, but the timing and absurdity just isn't there. The film is a series of long, boring jokes where you can see the punch line coming from a mile away, falling flat when it finally and mercifully arrives. Then the film starts setting up for the next joke and it you start checking your wristwatch to see how much is left before the credits start rolling.The project is an interesting idea, just not executed very well. Forgive the pun, but I don't think they really sunk their teeth into the topic. The bit about not being to use a mirror was promising, but it went on too long and never went past the obvious jokes. The most obvious logical questions never get asked: why aren't all those victims noticed? what do they do for money? how can they go centuries without updating their wardrobe or learning anything from the modern world? The overall pacing and direction struck me as aimless and flabby, maybe not a surprise for what is an exercise in improvisation, but just shows how difficult that medium can be to perform well. Finally, I also thought the explicit gore, while infrequent, really disrupted the comedic tone. Someone else noted that this might have been an effort better limited to a short film rather than a feature length project and I'd agree. A one-joke premise not all that well done to start with and stretched far past the breaking point."
" Something that will blow your fans off
",2017-07-01 00:00:00,10,"At first, when I found this piece, I was hesitant to see it. But once I did, I was mad that I hand't done before so.This movie is just pure EPIC. It puts a rambling twist on the modern world with those usual fantasies, old legends, reality show culture and pure ignorance. Every line of the script with it's words and improvisation, is carefully sifted through the masterminds behind it and made to be pure gold.A simple line of letters can not even begin to describe this masterpiece as the picture has a punch after a punch as the seconds fly by.Words of suggestion: If you are looking for some comedy to rest from your long day, this is not for you. If you are looking for something to spike all the funny-cells in your brain, look no further.A true and utter diamond of the industry that faces no boundaries from time nor century. I keenly hope this film will be a cult classic even 100 years from now."
" Hilarious. See it. Full Stop.
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,9,"They're all great. Viago is the best. I'm not sure when was the last time I saw a better comedic performance in a Hackneywood film ... a LONG time ago. Speaking of Hackneywood, this film further corroborates that Hackneywood & France now make the worst films in the world. Hackneywood's formula of preachy PC BS has become so rigor(mortis)ous that most of its films stink & even its best films have a bit of a stench to them. Indian, Russian, Kiwi, etc films with low-budgets make you say ""Oh, THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT!""Screw Hackneywood."
" Uniquely funny mockumentary
",2017-05-30 00:00:00,7,"I have seen a lot of footage of this movie, so I finally decided watch it. This movie is an excellent mockumentary, and absolutely hilarious. I love how they used very classic vampires instead of trying to make a modern version where they leave out certain parts of the myth or come up with new features for the vampires. What We Do In The Shadows is a brilliant fantasy-horror-comedy, and in its way very unique. It's definitely entertaining and well made, even if it's not really my type as a movie."
" Great movie for a Friday night with popcorn and some friends.
",2017-05-17 00:00:00,9,"Not a spoiler:So basically, the movie is a mockumentary (a mock documentary) about a bunch of vampires living in an old house. The movie just follows them around exploring the town during the night and what vampires (and the undead) generally do during their spare time. They do interact with the camera (in terms of breaking the 4th wall), however it doesn't ruin the movie (I found) in any way.If you are expecting great cinematography then you're going to be disappointed, the entire movie is just humour, the effects are basic, but the story line is what makes this movie worth watching.It's a movie you'd watch with some good friends on a late night with some snacks just to have a good time. Slight spoilers below: ----- ------ ---- Spoilers ----- ------ ----The movie generally is humorous, and even the new young characters introduced don't remove any of that, especially since the old vampires suddenly have all these new views of the world (cellphones, Skype etc).We get brief glimpses/introductions about other undead creatures (zombies, werewolves etc). Though they aren't the main focus, but do add a little to the movie.I do feel we could've seen some more of Peter (<3), but generally this is a movie just meant to be enjoyed, not critiqued for not being the next Kill Bill or Charlie's Angels."
" Good vampire mockumentary
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,9,"I had not read any reviews on this film beforehand, and started off wondering what on Earth I had put on. After 10 minutes I was loving the sense of humour and style of jokes.Definitely a great mockumentary for old school horror fans as long as you know beforehand not to take this film seriously. The acting is intentionally cheesy, and works well. Some of the situations these ""vampires"" end up in are truly hilarious."
" Paint Dries In The Shadows Even Without An Audience
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,1,"I love movies of all types and try to find the good in everything. I have finished watching even the most boring of movies to the end long after my wife has has given up. For example, I finished watching the intolerable ""Breaking Wind"" although I'll never get that part of my life back. After considering that ""What We Do In The Shadows"" is a mockumentary and watching for what I thought must surely be almost the entire movie, I was horrified that I was only 20 minutes into it. It was crude, poorly done, and just unwatchable. I turned it off despite having paid to rent it. Save yourself the grief and watch paint dry instead. This movie should have been left in the shadows."
" Clever, funny and unique
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,7,"I don't normally like comedy movies. My tastes are more towards live comedy and topical humour and these don't translate well to cinema. However this was a film I found really enjoyable and I actually lol'd a couple of times.I watched this film because I'm a fan of Jemaine Clement and I enjoyed Taika Waititi's previous film ""Boy"" (2010) immensely. I love their quirky NZ sense of humour; and despite not really liking their earlier collaboration (Eagle vs Shark, 2007), I thought this would be worth seeing. The cast is superb and the performances exceptional, from Taika Waititi's bossy vampire to Stu Rutherford's subtle discomfort. Throw in Clement as the burnt out vampire who struggles to display the great power he once had, and Rhys Darby doing his usual thing and there is not a moment in this film I didn't enjoy. This is a good one to watch with a few friends who share an enjoyment of dark humour."
" A fine showcase of undisguised Kiwi humour.
",2017-04-06 00:00:00,7,"If you don't 'get' Kiwi humour, you won't like this film. Kiwi humour is as unique as Aussie humour; not the same, but close enough for us to appreciate the differences. Other nationalities may be too (up themselves) I mean sophisticated, or find the jokes too low-brow, juvenile or too culturally specific. Each to his own I guess. I like Kiwi films. Just check out Bad Taste, Hunt for the Wilderpeople or Black Sheep. I tend to watch these films with an incredulous expression of WTF interposed between cracking up. Some of the jokes do fall flat but the undertone is usually enough to keep you engaged.The make-up is particularly good in WWDITS. The characters are well acted and the post-production crew did a great job of cutting 120 hours of improvised footage into this movie. Apparently, to maintain a documentary feel, no one had access to the script until they actually performed a take. Stu had no idea he was such a big part of the action.I don't want to call this film a guilty pleasure, because I did enjoy What We Do In The Shadows and I don't feel (very) guilty. Salute the Kiwi way and check out this film."
" Nails the mockumentary genre - hilarious
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,9,"WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS is a fake documentary following a group of vampires who have a shared living arrangement in a worn-down mansion in New Zealand. One of the new members brings a human into their group, which causes all sorts of troubles. An adventure filled with magic, werewolves and vampires ensues.WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS is one of the funniest movies I've seen since quite a while. The characters are plain hilarious, and each one is unique and also relatable. The characters are essentially just hyper-clichéd stereotypes, such as the German pedantic vampire with a penchant for organizing his friends' lives, or the sex crazed vampire master with a craving for torture. Yet, despite being such stereotypes, each character is quite believable—in part achieved through the great (and hilarious) performances.The movie exudes a sense of play and joy. It certainly doesn't take itself too seriously, but it's also not too silly to be dumb. A comedy like this falls or rises with the wittiness of its jokes and in this one, all the jokes are spot on. Definitely worth watching!"
" What We Do in the Shadows
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,8,"'What We Do In The Shadows' is an hilarious mockumentary film by the makers of 'Flight of the Conchords'. The movie is filed with brilliant homages and references to vampire films such as 'The Lost Boys', 'Twilight' and 'Let The Right One In'.The directorial style is very similar to the hit TV show 'The Office' as it is able to create humour in the realism and personal interviews and monologues. This method also allows it to be genuinely scary at times such as when we meet the housemate inspired by 'Nosferatu'. The extreme and realistic gore also comes across as very brutal and juxtaposes the silly gags. The actors are all very good. Dead pan. Great delivery."
" Hilarious
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,8,"Low budget comedy gold, this is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. The different personalities of all the flatmates drive some fantastic situation comedy. Basically these guys are all stunted at a maturity level somewhere in their 20's and they are vampires, and the jokes just play with that. ""The Beast"" is a running joke with a great payoff, won't spoil it but it was unexpected for me. This is the kind of movie where the low budget works in its favor, buckets of obviously fake blood and stiff costumes just make everything funnier. Definitely recommended."
" Pretty darn good The Office meets Vampires
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,8,"I think it's all there in the title. Lots of people are going way overboard with overwhelmed appreciation, most likely they didn't expect this to be any good really and got surprised, so this is definitely not a masterpiece but it's really very solid throughout.I've heard the criticism ""lack of plot"". This is clearly one of the strong points, if anything, of the film. There's lots of content, but not much story at all, so the film does superbly well at pace, and one thing it definitely nails which was tough was not being boring about an hour in. Lots of films are funny as a narrative written down on paper, and lots of fun during the first half an hour, but then becomes immensely silly and untenable as a full length film. This doesn't do that. At all. At no point does one feel he just 'gets it' and wants to move on to something else, it keeps it funny and interesting til the end.Humor wise, it's actually pretty funny. It avoids being the graphic horror kind, you can actually laugh if you don't like horror at all so it's not being self-indulgent or a generic homer (or a cultural homer, people completely uninitiated to Oceanic/kiwi culture, who just speak English, can get it just fine).The characters are good, and pretty darn well acted out. You'd really think the actors were East-European, but none of that.Funniest scene for me was the cops under the spell inspecting the premises.One last thing: in many specific places, with particular quotes or in general as a global metaphor, the film does well, subtly, at recognizing and establishing this world of vampires and werewolves etc...isn't all that different from the world of us humans in many respects.7.5 or sympathy 8/10."
" One joke, but a funny one
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,7,"What We Do in the Shadows is a mockumentary, made exactly in the style of all those reality-TV documentaries that fill the day-time television. The ones that follow the lives of ordinary people, are filled with people talking on couches or in cars, don't really contain anything of substance and are just pointless projects to blow money on. Except that in this case we follow a household of vampires living in New Zealand. Oh, they still argue about dishes and cleaning, but they also have conversations about laying down newspapers before drinking from someone because it's such a pain to get blood out of the cushions, and lots more.And to be completely honest, that's about it. That's the one joke the film has. But it's a really funny one. All the different vampire clichés are examined and mocked through our main characters from the young rascal of the group, Deacon, who's only 183 years old, to good old Petyr, who's over 8000 years old and lives in a stone coffin in the basement. The film also contains some other mythological creatures and shamelessly makes fun of them as well.To be fair, the one joke starts to grow a bit stale towards the end. I think that the film makers purposefully wanted to end the film without anything too major happening, because that's how all those ""real"" documentaries end, but it also means that there's not much of a story arc in the film. But, I was still chuckling at the joke even in the very end, so it didn't outlive its welcome. But it was a near thing.Still, the film is very much worth a watch if this is your kind of humour, which you should be able to surmise from what I've told you. If the idea is amusing to you, you're going to enjoy this film a lot."
" Bloody fun and amusing time
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,8,"This is a very amusing mockumentary style movie that focuses in on a few vampires that act like brothers. And their dynamics with one another when it comes to doing choirs, when new comers get involved and how they go about dealing with humans. I didn't particularly find this to be hilarious, but I got a few laughs out of it and it was very amusing to sit through. Maybe it's because the actors played their parts so well to the point it just came off very natural. Maybe it's their personalities in real life, but the interactions came off amusing and natural. It really did seem like it's how the actors in this would act like if they were vampires. The executions when it comes to the vampire elements onto screen is very cleverly done. It's like they thought up a lot of fun and creative ideas when it comes to the vampire myths and mashed it all together into a mockumentary. But the thing is, it all works together fluently and it all fits together. To describe this mockumentary, it's like a mix of ""The Office"", ""Borat"" and ""Napoleon Dynamite"" when it comes to the dynamics and vibe of it all. It start to slightly drag an hour in but overall it was a bloody good time.8/10"
" Vampires, not tramp-ires
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,9,"In search of the final nail in the coffin of the sordid cultural relevance of Edward and Bella? Look no further than the supremely delightful What We Do in the Shadows. Here, newbie vampire Nick drunkenly parades himself through the streets of Wellington, braying ""I AM TWILIGHT"" as a pick up line, only to be greeted with blank looks of vague derision. It's pristine satire - gently but insistently raucous, and playing more off of Nick's incredulous 'Isn't this cool anymore' expression than the gag itself. And the best bit? It's only one of a nearly nonstop smorgasbord of sneakily clever, deliciously quotable gags the film offers. If Shaun of the Dead's 'rom-zom-com' infused the zombie horror genre with a much- needed surge of frantic humour and schlubby humanity, What We Do in the Shadows blends vampires, who have already been subjected to oodles of daft action and risible romance, with The Office's mockumentary deadpan and a thoroughly New Zealand 'no bullsh*t' ethos, to similarly sterling effect. Co-director/stars Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi may thrive in 'chortle-funny' rather than the deep belly-laugh kind, but the chortles come so incessantly and raucously, they provide just as much of an ab workout. When you finally acclimatize to the spry wordplay, (""we are werewolves, not swear-wolves!""), lovingly integrated pokes at other vampire lore (including the bad etiquette of attending a vampire costume ball dressed as Blade, despite the fact that apparently ""Vampires love Wesley Snipes!""), and faux-historical interludes (apparently Naziism was just as controversial within vampire circles), you think you might find rest. But it's only moments before you're blindsided again by interludes involving a pair of impossibly stupid police officers, or laughs as unobtrusive as a cutaway to Waititi playing a mournful trumpet. The film is nonstop, evidencing a breezy, cheerful humour that is too earnest not to love. It helps that Waititi and Clement wear their hearts on their sleeves, with an uncanny ability to tease out the silliness in vampire lore while still committing to the emotion at the heart of it. There's an undercurrent of deep, anachronistic loneliness imbued in the film's leading trio of bloodsuckers, which somehow makes their interludes of squabbling over the (five years) overdue dishes, or forlornly learning how to use Facebook all the funnier in their sweetness. Similarly, in this realm of immortal horror monsters, death comes fast, furious, and with unapologetic bluntness, and the cheerful interjections of staggering bloodiness that sprinkle throughout the film (sometimes quite inconveniently getting all over the furniture), or omnipresent threat of the documentary crew getting devoured, keep the fun appropriately gruesome throughout. In terms of cohesiveness, there's no question that the film is unapologetically episodic, like a prolonged sitcom episode or beefed up SNL sketch, but Waititi and Clement keep things nimble enough to keep the joke from wearing thin, before calling it quits with a chipper non-climax that's so nonchalant, it's only retroactively that it feels like it delivers the loose resolution you'd hope for. And, honestly, material this hilarious earns all of the clumsy non-sequiturs it can muster. Still, the film's ruthless silliness and sweetness consolidate into the perfect cocktail (presumably a blood-tini) in the hands of the effortlessly funny cast. As the ageless, effete dandy and tentative moral compass of the group, Waititi himself is massively adorable, pairing bug-eyed cheeriness with a cartoon Dr. Strangelove accent to tremendous effect. Similarly, Clement commits his post-Concords star power perfectly towards the enormous presence of his larger-than-life, crestfallenly ineffectual Vlad the Impaler. Jonny Brugh's scene-chewing rock star arrogance is all the funnier once paired with the clueless boorishness of Cori Gonzalez-Macuer or the indignantly neurotic Jackie van Beek as scene partners. Finally, Stuart Rutherford redefines the potential of the comedic deadpan as impossibly unflappably software analyst (and very human) Stu,* while Rhys Darby (don't call him Murray) is as reliably hilarious as ever, cameoing as an exasperated werewolf. Thoroughly sweet, disarmingly sad, cheerfully bloody, and infectiously watchable, What We Do in the Shadows proves one of a preciously slim caste of horror spoofs with genuine wings. While it's inevitably prime material to be gobbled up by Flight of the Conchords converts, it's also accessibly goofy enough to stand alone as one of the most unobtrusively funny sleeper hit comedies of the past several years. Just be cautious not to falsely publicize the film amidst the lingering forces of Twihards, or risk incurring Clement and Waititi intoning that these are vampires, not tramp-ires. Zing. -9/10*Also, did you realize ""Don't eat Stu!"" was a pun? Because I didn't until long after the credits rolled. What a delightful film."
" A glorious mockumentary
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,7,"""New Zealand Director Taika Waititi delivers together with his longtime partner a very fresh take on the vampire genre."" Thats the last thing Mr. Waititi would like to read about this feature. It is so much more. Foremost it's a hilarious comedy with a very unique Style. Its not a horror film or anything the title might suggest. Waititi once said in an interview at the festival de Cannes, that they just tried to make it as funny as possible. And the amazing thing is that it doesn't feel like some one is trying to hard to be funny. Its a very well balanced firework of subtle gags. It captures you from the start. Not because of its suspense but with its great atmosphere, characters and especially because you will think ""what the **** am I watching"" but in a good way. A very good way."
