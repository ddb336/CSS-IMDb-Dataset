" I'm not loyal to this prince
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,4,"The Prince was directed by Brian A. Miller, written by Andre Fabrizio and Jeremy Passmore, and stars Jason Patric, Jessica Lowndes, Gia Mantegna, Rain, Bruce Willis, 50 Cent, Johnathan Schaech, Tyler Jon Olson, and John Cusack. It follows an ex-hitman as he returns to the life he left behind in order to save his daughter.Plotting is entirely derivative. If you've seen 2008's ""Taken"" then you've seen this. After Paul's (Patric) daughter Beth (Mantegna) stops answering his calls and her house looks vacant, Paul ventures to Louisiana to check in. He confirms her absence and goes to her old hangout spot and is given nothing by the staff; however, he runs into her friend Angela (Lowndes) who tells him she fell in with Eddie (Olson), a drug dealer. The two make their way to Eddie and Paul tries to shake Angela off as he goes to The Pharmacy (Fiddy) but she won't go. The majority of the movie is a string of ""go here, see him"" scenarios that rarely breaks its own pattern. On the way they pick up tails belonging to Omar (Willis), a previous target for Paul. Before the meeting with The Pharmacy, they visit Paul's old friends Sam (Cusack) and Frank (Schaech) who supply Paul with ammo and info to take on Omar and his henchmen, including Mark (Rain) to save Beth.Characters are all as stock as chicken soup, with exceedingly little to grab onto that hasn't been done better in Taken. Paul is a man with a checkered past that includes a dead wife and an accidental slaying of Omar's family that put him out of the game. While cliche, there was room for interesting interplay provided some key details were changed. Angela is supposed to be the unintentional sidekick but feels more like a kick to the head with her stupid decision making; including doing cocaine while trying to find her friend and refusing to listen to simple instruction. Sam and Frank are just the quick and easy ways for Paul to get the equipment he needs. Omar is the ruthless cookie-cutter bad guy with a lust for power, and Mark is the generic goon. Acting is minimal, with Patric the only one trying to articulate some steely anger beneath a quiet surface, the rest are all collecting checks; and as usual, Willis only wakes up for one scene at the end.Action is present but comes after long intervals of uninteresting characters spouting chiche and often vague dialogue. Unfortunately, instead of a brief reprieve from leaden plot stuff, the action isn't anything particularly special. While the gunplay is competently kept in frame and rarely shaky enough to be truly annoying, there's so little flare with the camerawork or character movement or even the weaponry that all gun-related scenes except one in The Pharmacy's den fall flat. Miller tries to stage a car chase, but that too comes off as unimpressive and more like some kind of prerequisite that needed to come in tandem with a rescue-related action/thriller like this. Some scuffles and hand-to-hand is here too, but it's overedited and shakily shot. That's a shame because Patric looked like he was doing fairly well with melee, or maybe the editor did too good a job at shaking the camera to give off that impression.Mechanically (get it?) the Prince is weak. Clearly shot for cheap, with presumably most of the budget going to getting famous faces like Willis, Cusack, Rain, and 50 on-board with the shoddy script. Locations are all how Miller likes them: dingy and barely lit, which does in some ways help the movie to better capture the griminess of city life and a lethal profession, but is equally damaging in that it just illustrates the priorities of the director; that a few names and faces are more important to him than the actual movie. Color grading is just like Vice (2015), which he would go on to direct and bathe in blue steel and purple tones to little effect aside from minor annoyance. Just a few props, some more stunts, or any set dressing would've gone a long way to mask the restrictions.I highly recommend Taken and its sequel, but the Prince just rides the coattails of those two movies, replicating their formula but not their energy, stuntwork, or pacing. Of all Miller's movies, this is one of his better efforts; although that doesn't mean much.45/100"
" That was bad
",2020-10-19 00:00:00,1,"It kept getting worse. You think to yourself, it can get better but you are immediately corrected."
" Could have been a 4 could have been a 7
",2020-09-03 00:00:00,6,"Overall I really liked the movie. Let's be clear, its a definite B movie so you have to qualify your expectations. Coming into the movie my expectations were super low, Old Bruce has been making a lot of crap lately so I didn't think this would be a classic at any stretch.
And it isn't.But it is actually pretty good, especially the first half. Patric is much better than usual in this movie and he makes the character work. Willis is essentially unnecessary in this film, but he is ok. Cusak is fine but I don't know why he has decided to run with the Mike Myers Halloween look, its not a winner :)What sucked about the film was a section involving multiple henchmen, who can't hit a target from 10 feet away even though you can assume they are meant to be specialists. And on top of this for some reason they are all wearing baseball caps and sunglasses INDOORS!!! Its is a really token effort at this stage of the film and did lower the rating from me at this point.Put that piss poor 10 minutes of the movie aside and you are left with one of the better B films of its time."
" My alternate ending...
",2020-08-21 00:00:00,3,"The only thing that could have saved this terrible movie is to have the car blow up at the end, full circle revenge."
" Not a bait and switch
",2020-08-10 00:00:00,8,"I generally choose to watch movies because of people in the cast. So her is Bruce Willis acting in a movie that does not feature him as the main character. Kudos to Mr. Willis for attracting attention so others could benefit from his fame. (note: quality of results from this trick can vary, a lot.) Knowing this, I read the story line and thought it might be interesting and we watched it. Pretty good stuff there. Mr. Willis showed up for more than 5 minutes at the beginning and performed admirably as did all the others in the cast."
" Uninspiring, unoriginal, and outright horrible
",2020-08-10 00:00:00,2,"Trying to find some positive sides of ""The Prince"" is about as hard and exhausting as swimming across the Atlantic. Willis and Cusack are basically making some - probably million dollar - cameos, so taking their performances in account is not possible. ""The Prince"" follows an unsympathetic father (Patric), trying to find his kidnapped daughter (Mantegna) in this ""Taken"" inspired failure, that ends with one of the decade's most yawning standoffs between Patric's flat character and Willis' equally flat character. Besides unintentional laughs, there are no reasons to give this movie more than one star."
" Oh, just shoot her already...!
",2020-07-09 00:00:00,4,"Bruce Willis has been through a spate of really mediocre parts; this time coupled with a really off-form John Cusack and a, frankly, abysmal Jason Patric as an erstwhile assassin who sets out to find his wayward daughter only to get drawn into a series of more, and more, preposterous gun battles. It really hasn't an original though in it's head and the inclusion of Rain as Willis' sidekick only leads me to believe that this was meant for the emerging markets in South East Asia. The directing is shockingly static; the editing the stuff of a jigsaw puzzle - only with bits frequently missing; and the ending just couldn't come quickly enough. Very poor."
" very disappointing
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,2,"Made it seem that Bruce Willis had a lead role, but barely was in the movie."
" great movie
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,10,"Lots of action,great cast,good story line. Don't know what these other idiots are wstching,!"
" What on Earth?
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,3,"BRUCE WILLIS! Hey, there's a Bruce Willis film we haven't seen before, crack out the wine and nibbles, it's bound to be good! Well, after about half an hour and no sign of ol' Brucie, we were beginning to think we'd dialled up the wrong film. All we had was some actor who we didn't know mumbling and slurring his lines so badly that we were only getting about one word in ten. And his female companion doing the same. Oh look - it's Bruce! Things'll perk up now. Where's he gone? What did he say? And look, it's John Cusack - what did he say? What was that he said? Was it important? Oh, not another ludicrous shoot-out, please - the bad guys are armed to the teeth but can't hit a barn door, but with every shot the hero brings down two thugs. What a load of rubbish."
" The only explanation is Bruce Willis and John Cusack lost a bet or owed a HUGE favor
",2020-03-19 00:00:00,2,"I really can't think of any other reason why they would have allowed this movie to be released as it is.Funny the speech Bruce Willis (Omar) gives about using his name and how it reflects on him...The only other explanation for this film with absolutely horrible writing is that they needed to launder money somehow...there are 32 producers for this ""thing""...bad filming, boring fighting scenes, horrible dialogues, and Hollywood really needs to stop the stupid chick act...Angela acts drugged, then dumb, then all Lolita, then like a little girl, then I don't know I lost the trail of bad acting. Beth just acted drugged all along. Just terrible"
" I don't know what this movie is
",2020-03-07 00:00:00,4,"It is bad, but they have big name actors in supporting roles. It is like they blew their budget on a couple big names, but how did a script so bad get a budget in the first place? You know it is bad when they put Bruce Willis front and center on the cover...and he is not the main character.Every thing felt low budget, and poorly thought out. literally one of the worst car chase scenes I have ever seen, if not the worse, and I have seen a few bad action movies. It could be the chick that can't act saying nonsensical lines, the dubbed in ""pull over"" that isn't even timed to make sense, or maybe it was the bad camera angles. It would be hard to make a worse action movie with the budget and actors they had."
" Jason Patrick not convincing as a super assassin
",2020-03-01 00:00:00,6,"The main thing holding me back on this movie was the inability of Jason Patrick to suspend my disbelief of him as a bad-ass. The acting was good, script good, but the usual kick-ass moves and bravado that Arnold or Bruce could (used to anyway) pull off just left me - well - disbelieving."
" Great Movie to Watch during Bad Movie Night
",2020-02-22 00:00:00,1,"Just when you thought the movie couldn't get worse, it does.It's stupid, unoriginal, predictive, forgettable and so bad it's good. Trey and Abed would've loved to rip on this mega piece of crap."
" Beyond Campy
",2020-02-20 00:00:00,2,"Actually, this film would have to work hard to get up to ""campy"" status. It's mostly just bland. 100% felt like Bruce Willis and John Cusack both just needed a little ""walkin around money,"" because neither was prominent or good in this. Writing is garbage. The lead actor should be in the credits of a real movie as ""key grip"" or ""assistant to..."" He has no business trying to carry a movie.How this film got as high as a 4.6 (as of this writing) I'll never understand."
" Top actors bad movie
",2020-01-24 00:00:00,1,"I still can't believe how this worst movie can attract so many top actors and they all can't save this movie. Never heard this movie in cinema whatsoever so my guess it's straight to DVD. They even had Rain, a top artist from S.Korea. How the? I'm shocked because S.Korea did produce a lot of good movies and how can Rain agree to be a part of this movie did blow my mind. Did they all get a huge money to act in this B-movie?"
" Was a better Rambo: Last Blood than Rambo: Last Blood
",2020-01-08 00:00:00,7,"Ok, So not the greatest movie there is, but enjoyable.
Nothing new, the acting was a little bit cardboard but still a great shoot'em up."
" Surprisingly good
",2019-12-17 00:00:00,9,"Got this for cheap at my local movie store didn't think I would be all that great. Yes it kind of stole ideas from bigger budget movies. The story is was pretty good, the acting was well done by most of the actors. Don't go into this expecting it to be the best movie of its genre. All I'm gonna say is I enjoy this movie, you might not but I did."
" Pretty Bad
",2019-12-10 00:00:00,3,"Like my title says, it's pretty bad. Sometimes I can get through bad acting, but there's too much of it. I wouldn't know the plot if it weren't for the description."
" Waste of time to watch
",2019-11-10 00:00:00,1,This is absolute garbage I am a big fan of Bruce Willis but this disaster is taking him down
" Star 2 is for the male actors
",2019-09-26 00:00:00,2,OMG. This is horrible. Well the female lead is horrible. She is completely unbelievable and fake beyond words. I wanted her to get shot within seconds of her first appearance. Lucky for me I tried this on Netflix and did not buy a ticket.
" Jessica Lowndes - Queen of bad acting!
",2019-09-05 00:00:00,2,"So they had a few big names and Hollywood legends (Willis, Cusack, Patric too) and then, to appeal to the mindless masses that is the young, male brain, they add in Jessica Lowndes -- HUGE MISTAKE!I get it, you needed some eye candy but come on! What was a typical revenge drama becane suffocated with Lowndes squeaks, shrieks and her failed attempt to seduce a man twice her age. Weak plot turned cr*p with the addition of ""Angela"". She's pretty but suits a ""Baywatch"" type movie where fun and giggles are the end of the spectrum and no one is gunning for an Oscar."
" Entirely disappointing!
",2019-07-28 00:00:00,1,"This script was embarrassing to listen to. Cringeworthy. The film had all the makings of something good: Patric was great; New Orleans -a great backdrop; the 2 young women - fine acting. But Bruce Willis blew this one. Understandably not having much of a plot to go on, but his character? Ridiculous!!!"
" Really not as bad as you all make it out to be
",2019-07-12 00:00:00,7,Captured a part from this movie and liked the atmosphere so decided to watch it from the beginning. Turned this is actually a decent action flick. Not your average smack everyone and shoot it all up type. Give it a try...
" What a joke
",2019-06-10 00:00:00,1,"What a horrible movie.
The main character goes walking and shooting. There's no strategy, intelligence or complex scenes. Just go inside and shoot.Bad guys are just stupid enough to miss all shots. There's no positioning, hiding or advanced techniques. Appear, shot a lot and miss everything. Good guy do one shot one kill.I gave 3 after watching moat of the film because it could not be saved..Well, but it managed to get worse. The final scene with bruce williams and his japanese partner. Hahaha what a stupid finish.
I had To login again here just to write a review and change the rating to 1.DO NOT WATCH THIS"
" OK, That's About It
",2019-04-16 00:00:00,6,"04/16/2019 Even with Bruce ""Whatcha talkin bout"" Willis and John Coo Coo there's no substitution for a sound well written storyline. The ending of this over the top killer in action movie was to predicable thus making it a typical generic shoot-em-up gangster movie and Mr. 50 pennies? ... he wasn't worth a nickel. (wish he'd get those big chompers filed down, they scare me). Better than a 4 or 5 Stars production but not by much. Again, predictable. Bon Appetit"
" Crappy version of John Wick
",2019-03-29 00:00:00,3,"Camera Work -Awful
Main Character-Flat
Bruce and John- Minimal Effort
Realism - Horrible
Action Scences- 80's style
Dialogue- ok
Overall finished it. Better than most I rate a 3"
" Not good
",2019-03-18 00:00:00,4,Saw this movie on Netflix thought it might be somewhat good with the actors they were able to acquire but turned out to be a low budget clique filled action movie. Do not waste your time not good.
" Surprisingly good movie for an evening
",2019-03-17 00:00:00,7,"If you like movies like ""A history of Violence"" with Mortensen this movie is something you might like.
An ambiguous hero with a dark past returns to save his daughter.
He must face old enemies and his dark deeds from the past.I think that the script is well written although have some gasps, but one can accept the plot. The characters are well written and trustworthy.
The biggest advantage is the role of Jason Patric. Although I did not value him as much as an actor, he convinced me with this movie. The roles of John Cusack (except oh his too-dark hair) and Jessica Lowndes (really nice play) are supporting the movie.
Willis is not very convincing (as he also is in most of his latest movies) and this is not the masterpiece of his acting.
The action flow is consistent and for me, it does not contain any important mistakes.
Of course, it is not the class A movie but regarding the small budget, the overall impression of the movie is quite good.
I rate it as 7 ******* and I can feedback this movie and advice it as worth seeing."
" This Whole Movie Is A Spoiler ...For the Film Industry
",2019-03-07 00:00:00,1,"1 Star for 50 Cent cameo. I lost it when he popped up on the scene. Hilarious. However, extremely lazy writing given the tired storyline.This father with a mysterious past is looking for his kidnapped daughter. We learn of his past through a series of flashback stories that are a series of narrated fade-aways. Some don't even have images and are just told by some guy.So we just watch this guy over here tell a story and that guy over there share a chilling experience with the father. Sometimes the father would tell a story about his own past.He finds his daughter. End of movie.This has to be a favor as none of these great actors had many lines lol.To sum it up: This should be in the ""Mother Goose/Storytime"" category."
" A Mob Boss with a Score to Settle
",2019-03-07 00:00:00,6,"""Paul"" (Jason Patric) is a mechanic living in a small town in Mississippi with a daughter in college and simply trying to make ends meet. This all changes when he receives a letter from the college essentially telling him that his daughter ""Beth"" (Gia Mantegna) is no longer a student there. He becomes even more concerned when he is unable contact her on her cellphone and as a result decides to seek out her bestfriend ""Angela"" (Jessica Lowndes) to find out what is going on. What he discovers not only horrifies him but also results in a trip to the ugly side of New Orleans where his former skills as a hitman for the mob are required in order to save the only thing that is precious to him. Now rather than reveal any more I would like to say that I liked the plot and thought that both Jason Patrice and Jessic Lowndes performed in a decent manner all things considered. However, I must admit that I didn't especially care for the acting of Bruce Willis (as ""Omar"") who has clearly had better days. Be that as it may, while this wasn't a great film by any means, I liked it none-the-less and have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average."
" Entertaining enough for a one-time watch
",2019-03-05 00:00:00,6,"Being a fan of Patric, Willis and Cusack, and having 90 minutes to spare, I decided to check this out on a whim. No, the story is nothing new or innovative. In fact, it's rather generic at times. But it kept me entertained thanks to a strong performance from Patric, and even Willis didn't seem to be phoning it in this time. John Cusack wasn't given enough to work with, unfortunately. The action is solid and the lead characters were likeable enough to keep me interested throughout. Ultimately, it's a decent revenge thriller worth checking out."
" Unfortunate
",2019-03-04 00:00:00,2,It's understandable in this day and age that finding an original script must be very difficult. What is very distressing is that money can be thrown at big name stars to do an unoriginal script. One would think that the level of some of the actors in this movie would be a bit more discerning about the roles they choose. It's easy to critique and hard to make real art...real art.
" Don't waste ur time....
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,2,It is so sad to see once revered actor Bruce Willis and to some extent John Cusack destroy their brand with these string of B Grade movies....Terrible movie with plot holes bigger than the craters on Mars.
" Not sure what you were expecting?!
",2019-01-17 00:00:00,8,"Ignore what you saw in the reviews and try it for itself. Bruce is in there for a camo (Like Schwarzenegger in Killing Gunther (give it a try)). These are just good films, don't expect too much and they'll deliver!"
" People who give this movie a 10 something really wrong with you
",2019-01-15 00:00:00,2,"Terrible sorry the people who give this movie a 10. Something really really wrong with you people. You people got to see some real movies with good acting The acting is garbage. Terrible

" A Pretty Good Action Thriller That Misses
",2019-01-15 00:00:00,8,"12 February 2015. With a new and brilliant overall directorial and script approach, The Prince almost avoids the typical, traditional action thriller motif. Unfortunately along the way, it misses a few key elements, as this movie stumbles a bit from being perhaps the first action thriller classic since The Bourne Identity (2002). There is a special charm and distinctive plot flavor that permeates this movie. It is rich with humaneness and there is a pungent odor of unwritten honor in the script's characters. Even the ""pick something up"" from a pawnshop scene is radically different from traditional shoot'm up, bang, bang scenario. Like Bourne Identity, The Prince doesn't become a lurid sexual exploitation film and the role of the girlfriend is fascinating in its depiction in the movie. While John Cusack's secondary role might be considered underdeveloped and underused, his role as a supporting character might actually add to the integrity of this more divergent version of an action movie.An energized, pounding rhythmic musical beat paces along with the movie. The movie moves slowly at first, but continually building at its own speed. There is a later shoot out, and it's a puzzling question of believability and yet there is also something about the rapid pacing and quick action of the scene that makes it more effective in its way, instead of the traditional drawn out, over-stylized special effects action scene.The two major problems with this movie is its less than convincing protagonist. His intellectual and fighting skills aren't really displayed with much more than a Terminator-like ferocity. About a little more than a third of the way into the movie there is a chase, one that offers a stark difference with Jason Bourne's film, Bourne Identity. Instead of some almost supernatural telegraphed ability In the to evade and elude and instead a dependence on what up until now was a much more performance-based, rough but authentic build up to a very classy espionage, taking movie. The climatic ending also doesn't end at the level of satisfaction or completeness that the movie has been building up to. The director had a choice between a startling more surprising ending that might include a more human element or the full display of the protagonist's abilities and talents which were missing.In short, The Prince was decent but more of a big missed opportunity."
" Worth a watch
",2019-01-11 00:00:00,5,I like many others turned it on for Wilis and Cusack but they didn't do much for the movie. Nevertheless the main actor kept me going and I enjoyed the movie. Some of the characters are pretty unbelievable but didnt detour from the plot.
" Horrible
",2019-01-07 00:00:00,1,"This whats happening now good actors get together with a noobie director and make a very poor low budgeted movie hoping to fetch top $$$$$$$$$$ and split it, like really?? bruce??? Cusack?? patick??? aand they even made the movie poster wrong with their names on the wrong picture omg, most of the scene are wrong wrong and very wrong, it should have been better if bruce willis is the father of that messed up girl, like from the start everything is wrong, all the freaking scene is wrong...."
" Waste of your time
",2019-01-05 00:00:00,2,"Very anoying even, a shame that Brice Willis and John Cusack are in this movie."
" Come on people, not THAT bad.
",2018-12-31 00:00:00,6,"An average thriller, you get what you would expect. Car chases, bad guys, revenge, drug lords, damsel in distress, shoot outs, anti hero, etc. It was not as bad as some here post. I've seen WAY worse. The lead, Patric, wasn't bad. Willis and Cusak were wasted. Overall, slightly above average, hence my 6 rating."
" Great movie
",2018-12-21 00:00:00,10,"The problem with critical reviewers starts where everyone expected to watch a massive performance by bruce Willis and too much actions and excitements overall. Movies shouldn't necessarily have those super natural specifications to be called great action movies in my point of view. Well, it was not a costly movie at all for the producer, and all the actors/actresses did their roles perfectly ; specially Jason patric. My wife and I enioyed a lot watching it. Highly recommended"
" Worst movie of Bruce Willis
",2018-11-18 00:00:00,1,"Total waste of time. The movie looks like a cheap Asian movie.
Be careful, if you like Bruce Willis then don't watch this movie, you'll hate him!"
" Done to death
",2018-10-26 00:00:00,4,"THE PRINCE is yet another B-movie thriller advertised as a ""Bruce Willis"" movie that turns out to contain the actor for about a quarter of the running time, if that. Instead the main plot is about ageing action man Jason Patric on the trail of some gangsters who've kidnapped his daughter. It's the kind of film that's happy to go through the motions without ever offering much of note, other than some supporting roles for the likes of John Cusack, Rain, and 50 Cent, none of whom are given much to do. The action scenes are a bit too digital and overall there's little here that hasn't been done to death."
" Weak mercy
",2018-10-21 00:00:00,3,"Saw 'The Prince' because Bruce Willis has done good films and given good performances in the past, 'Die Hard' is a genre landmark and his performance is iconic in that. The title and poster also intrigued. Have an appreciation for action and the idea for the story sounded interesting. Expectations were not high though, because Willis has been past prime for a while (several bad films and has looked tired and disengaged a lot).'The Prince' is not a good representation of him, if not as bad as the recent 'Reprisal'. 'The Prince' is a better film to that while having similar, actually even the same, faults. It fails in the action stakes, faring very unfavourably in relation to other films seen in the genre, and while anything involving abductions and rescues have been very engagingly done on film 'The Prince' manages to portray it with no thrills complete with dull pacing, lots of silliness and endless predictability. Not hating it with pleasure, it's my honest opinion and my negative feelings towards it are regrettable.Will say that there are more visually amateurish films around, there are moments where there is slickness and style and the photography is nowhere near as disorganised as that for 'Reprisal'.John Cusack and 50 Cent give the most engaged performances, even if Cusack has little to do.However, for someone highly billed, Willis is used poorly, he looks tired and like he didn't want to be there. Jason Patric completely lacks intensity and even charisma, very anaemic. Everybody else is bland and annoying.Visually, the film does lack cohesion. The music is too loud, should have been used far less and some of the placement is inappropriate. Brian A. Miller directs like he was inexperienced to directing when in reality he wasn't, there is just no energy, momentum or finesse and the non-action oriented parts are handled so indifferently.Dialogue from the very start to the contrived climax is riddled with clichés and cheese and what little there is of the story has no surprises, fun or tension, is very pedestrian in pace and fails to make sense or have signs of maturity. Tension and suspense are non-existent. 'The Prince' goes overboard on the ridiculousness and lack of plausibility and at other points it takes itself too seriously. The action is clumsily choreographed, sloppily edited and not exciting or suspenseful at all, as well as looking at least twenty years out of date and relying far too heavily on convenience. The characters are not compelling or easy to get behind. Do not expect every character in every film to be likeable when characters in numerous films purposefully aren't, but it is an issue if there are characters meant to be rootable and 'The Prince' has that problem.Concluding, weak but not a complete shambles. 3/10 Bethany Cox"

" Trying to copy Taken
",2018-09-10 00:00:00,3,"This film was just unoriginal and boring. I couldn't take Bruce Willis as the villain seriously, it just doesn't work, and neither does this film. This is just a copycat of Taken, this film is the exact reason why I hate mockbusters in general, The Prince is just so inept and uninspired, and 50 Cent's appearance does not make it ok."

Paul (Jason Patric) her father, we later discover is the title character. He was a bad guy hitman 20 years ago and skipped town after a hit went bad. Now he is back and must face old enemies in a script so formulaic, you don't need to watch the film.Jason Patric is no Charles Bronson, Jason Stratham, or Liam Neeson, but he was more convincing than say Neil Patrick Harris or Lou Diamond Phillips. Jessica Lowndes played his tag-a-long in an unrealistic role but is part of the formula. John Cusack had a cameo appearance as did 50 Cent. Willis managed to get some more screen time than ""The Cold Light of Day"" but it wasn't impressive as he phoned it in.Mediocre action flick rental at best. Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
" Great movie!!! Better than Taken
",2018-04-02 00:00:00,10,"Great cast. Great action, and I have watched over and over again. It is a must see!!"
" Crap on its pure form
",2018-03-23 00:00:00,1,"Nothing could save this movie. It is lame from beginning to end. The acting is so bad that even Bruce Willis was unconvincing. The story makes no sense and the main character is laughable. 
Don't waste your time."
" So bad
",2018-03-21 00:00:00,1,"I don't think I every wrote a negative review for IMDb, but this film certainly deserves it. I only watched it because it was on tv and Bruce Willis was in it. Turned out his role was rather insignificant. This movie is a complete waste of time. The moral of the story (not that there is any moral or much of a story): if you have a daughter who ran away and you want her back, you can legitimately kill dozens of people to get her back. Neither the story nor the actors impressed me at all. I would have liked to make an exception for Bruce, but sorry Bruce, not this time. The Prince? The Pauper, more likely."
" Bad...Really Bad
",2018-02-17 00:00:00,2,The storyline has been done so many times it is beyond predictable. Jason Patrick had no edge or mystery the way a character like this should have. Bruce Willis phoned in his performance and John Cusack must have lost a bet to get stuck with this POS of a script. The action scenes reminded me of 1990's arcade shooting games with crappy AI that pops up bad guys up one at a time. The acting was SO bad I started writing this review during the final scene so I could at least be be doing something productive with my time. This movie is so bad it is not even one of those its so bad its good movies. Its just bad.
" A poor man's John Wick
",2017-12-19 00:00:00,4,This is like a poor mans photocopy of John wick with a little splash of Taken. Bad
" Corny
",2017-12-14 00:00:00,4,"It is a knock off version of Liam Neeson's Taken. My biggest issue was how corny the movie seemed. Its like every second through the script they tried so hard to portray the Prince as this Rambo, james bond plus ethan hunt, mixed with a little bit of john wick dude. that back in the day was the baddest human that ever lived but now has a beer belly and just wants to live a peaceful life. there was no flow or sense to a lot of the stuff in the movie. Like barely 2 seconds after meeting his daughter's friend they are having some sort of sexually tense scene. And I'm confused to why they would make that 20 year younger character the part time love interest. It is just good to watch on a train or something to pass time"
" Another movie where the bad guys with machine guns can't hit a target.
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,5,"If I had the chance to chose again I wouldn't go for this movie again. There are way better action movies than The Prince. The story is just déjà-vu, done before and way better. Don't think because you have some names like Bruce Willis and John Cusak that it will be a good movie. In fact Bruce Willis has his fair share of bad movies in his career and this is one of them. He isn't the main character though. The main character is Jason Patric, and his acting skills in The Prince are lame. Just like the story. If you like stories where a guy armed with a pistol takes on dozens of heavily weaponed crooks and manage to avoid multiple machine-gun shots while he manages to kill everybody with one single shot than this movie might be for you. Personally I have problems with that kind of unrealistic scenes. I feel like a fool when I watch that kind of action. Just pass on this movie, you'll save some precious time of your life."
