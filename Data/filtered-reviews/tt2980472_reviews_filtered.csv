" Just watch it...
",2021-04-10 00:00:00,9,"It's a great movie. It touches on so many problems people face on a day to day basis. It manages bring a sense of levity to very serious issues like depression, suicide, and homophobia, without belittling the seriousness of the issues."
" Surprising genre piece
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,8,"I couldn't believe Courtney Cox directed this. I have seriously underestimated her. She brought a fine, sensitive touch to a movie that could have been bawdier and less successful. This is a ""checkmark"" movie, meaning it meets all the social justice demands for diversity blah, blah. But even for a checkmark movie it manages to find fertile soil for drama, comedy and romance. A few of the plot points are incredulous but I guess that goes with the genre. If you like the odd romance movie in your life but can't stomach the Dove channel, then give this movie a look."
" for the crying and laughing at the same time...
",2020-10-25 00:00:00,7,"""i'm gay, dad, not blind.""I love this movie. Realised on the second viewing how much of an ensemble this is, as the script is concerned with the lives Scott's central character touches on his journey to suicide. The cast is amazing. Scott is at a career best here, with Thirlby, Dillahunt, Walsh and Riggle bringing so much life to their characters. It's a beautiful script from Flebotte, at times hilarious and moving, and Cox manages the tone perfectly. Easily one of my favourites."
" ODDLY ENTERTAINING, PART COMEDY, PART DRAMA, PART CRAZY
",2020-09-08 00:00:00,7,"Surprisingly funny movie about a guy who goes back to confront his past before he takes his life. He visits old teachers, his brother, mother, his high school bully and an old flame. Many of these people were part of his troubled past but he learns a lot about why people acted the way they did. Their lives wound up being a lot more screwed up than his.
This movie has some mature themes so it's not for everyone. I was laughing out loud for much of the movie, but that alternated with some really touching scenes. Overall I found it very entertaining!"
" A poignant movie with heart...
",2020-07-17 00:00:00,10,"Hopefully it helps people who feel hopeless. It's a story told many times in a million ways, but it's important to linger in the ether...I had never heard of it and it just popped on the radar on Tubi...I like to think it's kismet in how I've personally felt lately... Thanks to those who put their hearts on their sleeve! :)"
" More of a drama than comedy
",2020-07-15 00:00:00,7,"This is a film which may have went under the radar during its release. It isn't too special but there is enough interest and engagement to keep watching until the end.Lead by a very solid and likable lead character in Seann William Scott, he shows he is more than capable of playing a Stifler.With little expectations, Just Before I go is quite a depressing but thoughtful film. Although predictable- especially in the end, the journey we see the character going through from start to finish is worth the watch.The critics appear to be quite harsh with their rating- with a current 10% on Rottentomatoes, that doesn't do this film justice. Am glad having watched the film before seeing its rating, otherwise may have skipped out on this one.We understand this isn't the best film out there but for what's its worth, it is solid. Not too long either, good for an afternoon viewing alone. Makes you ponder about life afterwards. Perhaps critics expectations were too high?Some of the comedy was rather unhumorous, over the top, and could have been left out (for instance a running gag involving the wife ""sleep masturbating""- one time was enough. It just wasn't funny and seemed a little forced for laughs). As well as the character of Lucky- he was there for the comic relief but was rather annoying.The film shines most during the scenes involving Seann William Scott and Olivia Thirlby. We see the chemistry evolve as expected.There is also a running subplot involving the son and his coming out. Everything in the end comes full circle and seems to work out for the best. It may be predictable but it was the most justified way to end the film.For a film that isn't exactly old, there is definitely a certain ""nostalgic"" feeling. Perhaps others may feel the same way watching for the first time."
" Simply Perfect
",2020-07-02 00:00:00,10,"I might get some negative feedback for this comment but I would go as far as to say that Just Before I Go is just as powerful as It's A Wonderful Life when it comes to suicide prevention. But it's such a different approach which makes it powerful in a completely different way. The way this film depicts the character facing his past and going through experiences that help him reframe the past is profound and it's something that anyone who is contemplating suicide due to a troubled past should see. This perfectly portrays that things are not as bad as we remember and it's possible to face and heal our demons. I personally love that such a powerful subject was handled and told in a way that comes off lightly with silly, twisted humor. This movie is brilliant and I am so thankful for it."
" Kind of hit the right buttons about mid to late 2000s society
",2020-02-19 00:00:00,6,"Kind of hit the right buttons about society being bully, about being scared about their sexuality being announced , about their family problems, husband & wife problems, siblings problems etc. They covered all of the little bits of the above list. Is kind of drama with bit of comedy but with the cast of old Stiffler from American Pie; you can't really make a drama movie with him no matter how hard anyone tries. But def worth to watch once or twice. If this movie was 50/50 of drama & comedy then would've been better but is more 80/20 that's why I gave it a 6 out of 10. Maybe would be better if it was another cast than the old Stiffler"
" Watchable
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,6,Predicable romantic comedy that works sometimes and other times just makes you wonder what they were thinking. If I am going to kill myself I am not going to go back and get revenge on all the people that did me wrong in my last days.
" Left a taste in my mouth not quite like cherry
",2019-09-19 00:00:00,6,"I want to give this movie props for being about something so daring with such a familiar actor.But what I didn't suspect was that it would begin somewhere so dark only to build to something that thinks it's life affirming but is actually just a bit simpering, asking the audience meet them more than a little past half way.It's often uncomfortable and charming but that's mixed with this romcom style triteness that lets down what this movie could have been.Overall an interesting and worthy feature with Williams giving a type destroying performance as a man trapped between comic and tragic figure.The humour is delightfully painful. The pathos is just painful."
" NOT what I expected, not a comedy. Deep.
",2019-02-01 00:00:00,6,"What I sat down to watch this movie, I expected a Sean William Scott comedy. And the channel listed it as comedy. But this movie is all about a family the each has extreme issues that hasn't told the other about and they just ignore it. Well everything's come to a boiling point and little brother's back in town with his own issues and everything blows up and everyone has to confront their issues. By doing so they all save each other. It's a powerful story about being true to yourself and loving each other for who you are. I would have rated it higher, it just took too long to get to where it was going and I think the writing was just too bland. It's like a lot of these movies nowadays where it makes people's lives out to be so miserable and boring and the movie it's just aren't about motivating people and making them feel good anymore. Even when there is a good message the movies riding is just miserable. Not trying to dissuade anybody from this movie because it does have a good story line and a good message."
" Really enjoyable heartwarming film
",2019-01-18 00:00:00,10,"Refreshing to see Sean William Scott play a different character to the norm. Serious topics covered in a light hearted way - even funny at times. Good cast, good film - definitely better than expected."
" Disappointing
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,2,"This film tries hard to be funny with the use of foul language and some crudity...but unlike Seans older films, it fails miserably. Total fail"
" Fantasticly understated
",2018-11-24 00:00:00,10,"The characters in this film are brilliantly interlinked around the themes of depression, suicide, loss, and and the general downs of life.What really struck me is how the film deals with how our actions affect others. From the bully who hates his abusive father to the teacher who sees her son in a student. The man whose wife cheats on him, leading to his utter desperation, sleeping with another man's wife, and the girl who just wanted someone to make her feel she's worth hanging around for. This film is an intricate look at the complexities of life, and the pressures of trying to live. Or die."
" Just Before I Go
",2018-10-10 00:00:00,10,"Amazing. The fact that this is Courtney Cox's first movie debut as a director is spectacular and I cannot see how this movie has not been given a higher rating. I have always been a fan of Sean and Olivia and their chemistry in this is nothing short of Brilliant. Some pretty good humorous laughs in between, but in the end a very powerful message being delivered to the world. How will you live your life? Full of excitement and wonder or just living to fill the void? -iChad"
" This movie deserves more stars
",2018-10-02 00:00:00,10,"Although raunchy, it has an inspirational message. I thought it was pretty funny and it's just my kind of goofy. I love Shawn William Scott and thought the cast was great. Well worth watching."
" So glad I saw this
",2018-08-01 00:00:00,8,Suicide is a complex topic and every case is different. This movie was funny in places and sensitive where it needed to be. Well worth the experience.
" Hate, Hate, Hate this movie
",2018-07-12 00:00:00,1,This movie disgustingly tries to make sympathetic characters out of cruel bullies.
" Nothing beats living
",2018-02-16 00:00:00,8,"Ted (Seann William Scott) lived in a small town and moved to California. His biography is quickly given to us in the first few minutes. We discovered he was bullied (Rob Riggle) in school, berated by his seventh grade teacher (Beth Grant), and had a crush on a little blond girl (Mackenzie Marsh). His dad (Clancy Brown) died when he was young leaving him to live with his uncouth brother (Garret Dillahunt) and mom (Connie Stevens) who has taken up with a female Elvis impersonator (Diane Ladd). When his wife Penny (Elisha Cuthbert) leaves him, he vows to return home, complete a bucket list and kill himself.In an attempt to complete his bucket list, he discovers that life has moved on and his bucket list doesn't go as planned. Along the way he meets Greta (Olivia Thirlby) who he confides his plan. Greta insists on filming the events as his ""Death Muse.""The film deals with teenage homosexuality seriously and sleep walking masturbation not so seriously. This is an indie style quirky comedy/drama/romance whose message is to fill up your life to get rid of the emptiness.Guide: F-bomb. No nudity. Implied sex. Female masturbation. Genitals outlined. Biggest camel toe I have every seen."
" Sometimes facing the past is the key for the future.
",2017-09-24 00:00:00,8,"Whoa! Why I did not see it before! Seems I totally underestimated it. Lots of good films were released in the 2015 and this is surely one of them. Among the small cost films, this is one of the top 5 films. There's no logic, just a simple storyline with a dark humour. Most of the scene seems deliberate, yet as a one film, very enjoyable.A man whose life has never been so colourful, was once saved by a woman who later married him. But now they are separating and he's now getting back to his old position. Instead, he decides to end his life. Before that, he makes a list of 'to do'. Hence returns his hometown to face his past. Begins his quest which will be accompanied by a young woman. The rest of the film focused on the final days of his life.I saw it, that's all matters. Because, being a cinephile, I should not miss such a nice film. It's common some films go unnoticed, thankfully I found it. Now I definitely suggest it to others. Awesome performances. I liked every one of them. Sean William was top of it. Olivia Thirby was cute as usual. I had some good laughs, a few of them were loud ones. I could not believe it was made by Coutney Cox. She did a fine job. It was screenplay she has got, but I hope she will be doing more such heartwarming drama films.8/10"
" first timer Cox
",2017-07-25 00:00:00,4,"Ted Morgan (Seann William Scott) struggles with a middling empty life. He lost his father as a child. He escaped to LA and married lively Penny (Elisha Cuthbert). When she leaves him for another man, he contemplates suicide. He decides to go back to his home town Kempton to confront his past tormentors before his final act. His police brother Lucky (Garret Dillahunt) is married to Kathleen (Kate Walsh) with two boys. Kathleen is a masturbating sleepwalker. His nephew Zeke (Kyle Gallner) is in the closet secretly dating Romeo. His mother (Connie Stevens) lives in the trailer park with her lover Shirley Bromfield. He goes to confront his mean teacher in her retirement home and finds her granddaughter Greta (Olivia Thirlby). Greta starts following him to document his dark journey. Rowley Stansfield (Rob Riggle) is the reformed school bully. Vickie is the nice girl from school who got stuck in an unhappy marriage with five kids.Courteney Cox tries her hand at directing. It's a really, really tough movie to get right especially as a first time director. It's all very flat. The humor isn't there and it's not specifically dark enough. The visual sensibility is too bright. One imagines a more experienced voice could get the tone right. There is plenty of acting skills on the cast but they can only do so much. SWS is doing depressed seriousness. Thirlby is the only one able to inject any kind humor with some heartbreak. The weird stuff could be funny on the page but most of it doesn't translate onto the screen. Gallner is going for the dramatic awards. There is a lot of heart but it gets undermined by humor that doesn't work. The movie is all over the place. The level of difficulty is simply too high for newcomer Cox."
